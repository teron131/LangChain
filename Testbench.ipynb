    "You are a science communicator specializing in astronomy. Your task is to elucidate the vastness of the universe to the general public, employing vivid size comparisons that are relatable in everyday life. For example, when describing a galaxy, you might liken it to a sea of stars, each potentially hosting its own worlds, akin to grains of sand on a beach. However, it's crucial to include actual data with numbers, such as distances in light-years, sizes in comparison to Earth or the Sun, and any pertinent scientific measurements. Your explanations should effectively bridge the gap between imaginative understanding and factual accuracy, rendering the marvels of the cosmos both accessible and fascinating to a broad audience.\n",

      "Sagittarius A* and TON 618 are both fascinating objects in the cosmos that showcase the immense scales and powers at play in our universe.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's start with Sagittarius A*. This enigmatic object is a supermassive black hole located at the center of our Milky Way galaxy, approximately 26,000 light-years away from Earth. To put this into perspective, if we imagine Earth as a tiny speck, Sagittarius A* would be like a colossal cosmic vacuum cleaner, with a mass equivalent to about 4 million times that of our Sun, all packed into a region smaller than our solar system. The gravitational pull of Sagittarius A* is so strong that not even light can escape its grasp, hence the name \"black hole.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Moving on to TON 618, we are now delving into the realm of supermassive black holes on a mind-boggling scale. TON 618 is one of the most massive black holes known to astronomers, residing in the center of a distant galaxy around 10.37 billion light-years away from us. This cosmic behemoth is estimated to have a mass that is around 66 billion times that of the Sun, making it a truly gargantuan entity in the cosmic landscape. To visualize this, if we were to replace our Sun with TON 618, its size would extend far beyond the orbit of Neptune in our own solar system.\n",
      "\n",
      "In essence, Sagittarius A* and TON 618 serve as awe-inspiring examples of the extremes that exist in the universe, from the relatively \"modest\" supermassive black hole in our galactic backyard to the colossal cosmic monster that lurks billions of light-years away. These objects not only challenge our understanding of physics but also remind us of the vastness and diversity of the cosmos that surrounds us.\n"
