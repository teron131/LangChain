=====================================

Gradient descent is a fundamental algorithm in machine learning and optimization. It's a first-order optimization technique used to minimize the loss function in various machine learning algorithms, such as linear regression, logistic regression, and neural networks. In this explanation, we will delve into the concept of gradient descent, its types, and how it works.

**What is Gradient Descent?**
---------------------------

Gradient descent is an iterative algorithm that aims to find the optimal values of model parameters that minimize the loss function. The loss function, also known as the cost function or objective function, measures the difference between the model's predictions and the actual outputs. The goal of gradient descent is to adjust the model parameters to minimize this difference.

**How Does Gradient Descent Work?**
-----------------------------------

The gradient descent algorithm works as follows:

1. **Initialization**: The algorithm starts by initializing the model parameters with random values.
2. **Forward Pass**: The algorithm passes the input data through the model to obtain the predicted outputs.
3. **Loss Calculation**: The algorithm calculates the loss function for each sample in the dataset.
4. **Backward Pass**: The algorithm computes the gradients of the loss function with respect to each model parameter. This is done using the chain rule of calculus.
5. **Parameter Update**: The algorithm updates the model parameters by subtracting the product of the learning rate and the gradient from the current parameter value.
6. **Repeat**: Steps 2-5 are repeated until convergence or a stopping criterion is reached.

**Mathematical Formulation**
---------------------------

Let's consider a simple example to illustrate the mathematical formulation of gradient descent. Suppose we have a linear regression model with a single feature `x` and a target variable `y`. The model can be represented as:

`y = w * x + b`

where `w` is the weight and `b` is the bias term. The loss function can be defined as the mean squared error (MSE) between the predicted outputs and the actual outputs:

`L = (1/2) * (y_pred - y_actual)^2`

The goal of gradient descent is to minimize the loss function `L` with respect to the model parameters `w` and `b`. To do this, we need to compute the gradients of the loss function with respect to `w` and `b`:

`dL/dw = -x * (y_actual - y_pred)`
`dL/db = -1 * (y_actual - y_pred)`

The model parameters are then updated using the following equations:

`w = w - alpha * dL/dw`
`b = b - alpha * dL/db`

where `alpha` is the learning rate.

**Types of Gradient Descent**
-----------------------------

There are several types of gradient descent algorithms, including:

* **Batch Gradient Descent**: This type of gradient descent uses the entire dataset to compute the gradients and update the model parameters.
* **Stochastic Gradient Descent**: This type of gradient descent uses a single sample from the dataset to compute the gradients and update the model parameters.
* **Mini-Batch Gradient Descent**: This type of gradient descent uses a small batch of samples from the dataset to compute the gradients and update the model parameters.
* **Momentum Gradient Descent**: This type of gradient descent adds a momentum term to the update equation to help escape local minima.

**Advantages and Disadvantages**
-------------------------------

Gradient descent has several advantages, including:

* **Simple to Implement**: Gradient descent is a simple algorithm to implement, especially for small datasets.
* **Fast Convergence**: Gradient descent can converge quickly to the optimal solution, especially when the learning rate is properly tuned.

However, gradient descent also has several disadvantages, including:

* **Sensitive to Hyperparameters**: Gradient descent is sensitive to the choice of hyperparameters, such as the learning rate and the batch size.
* **Prone to Local Minima**: Gradient descent can get stuck in local minima, especially when the loss function is non-convex.

**Real-World Applications**
---------------------------

Gradient descent has numerous real-world applications, including:

* **Image Classification**: Gradient descent is used in image classification tasks, such as recognizing objects in images.
* **Natural Language Processing**: Gradient descent is used in natural language processing tasks, such as language modeling and text classification.
* **Recommendation Systems**: Gradient descent is used in recommendation systems to personalize product recommendations for users.

**Conclusion**
==============

Gradient descent is a fundamental algorithm in machine learning and optimization. It's a simple yet powerful algorithm that can be used to minimize the loss function in various machine learning algorithms. While gradient descent has several advantages, it also has several disadvantages, such as sensitivity to hyperparameters and proneness to local minima. Despite these limitations, gradient descent remains a widely used algorithm in many real-world applications.

=====================================

Gradient descent is a fundamental algorithm in machine learning and optimization, used to minimize the loss function of a model by iteratively adjusting its parameters. It is a first-order optimization technique that uses the gradient of the loss function to update the model's parameters in the direction of the negative gradient, which is the direction of the steepest descent.

**Mathematical Background**
-------------------------

To understand gradient descent, we need to introduce some mathematical concepts. Let's consider a simple linear regression model, where we want to predict a continuous output variable `y` based on a single input feature `x`. The model's parameters are the weights `w` and bias `b`, and the predicted output is given by:

`y_pred = w * x + b`

The loss function, also known as the cost function or objective function, measures the difference between the predicted output and the actual output. A common choice for the loss function is the mean squared error (MSE):

`L(w, b) = (1/2) * (y_true - y_pred)^2`

where `y_true` is the actual output.

The goal of gradient descent is to find the values of `w` and `b` that minimize the loss function `L(w, b)`. To do this, we need to compute the partial derivatives of the loss function with respect to `w` and `b`, also known as the gradients.

**Gradients and Partial Derivatives**
------------------------------------

The partial derivative of the loss function with respect to `w` is:

`∂L/∂w = - (y_true - y_pred) * x`

The partial derivative of the loss function with respect to `b` is:

`∂L/∂b = - (y_true - y_pred)`

These partial derivatives represent the rate of change of the loss function with respect to `w` and `b`. The negative sign indicates that the loss function decreases as `w` and `b` increase.

**Gradient Descent Algorithm**
-----------------------------

The gradient descent algorithm updates the model's parameters `w` and `b` using the following iterative formula:

`w_new = w_old - α * ∂L/∂w`
`b_new = b_old - α * ∂L/∂b`

where `α` is the learning rate, a hyperparameter that controls the step size of each update.

The algorithm starts with an initial guess for `w` and `b`, and then iteratively updates them using the above formula until convergence or a stopping criterion is reached.

**Types of Gradient Descent**
-----------------------------

There are several variants of gradient descent, including:

* **Batch Gradient Descent**: This is the simplest form of gradient descent, where the model's parameters are updated using the entire training dataset at once.
* **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)**: This variant updates the model's parameters using a single example from the training dataset at a time. SGD is more efficient than batch gradient descent, but can be noisier.
* **Mini-Batch Gradient Descent**: This variant updates the model's parameters using a small batch of examples from the training dataset at a time. Mini-batch gradient descent is a compromise between batch gradient descent and SGD.

**Convergence and Stopping Criteria**
--------------------------------------

Gradient descent converges to a local minimum of the loss function when the updates become very small. There are several stopping criteria that can be used to determine when to stop the algorithm, including:

* **Maximum number of iterations**: Stop the algorithm after a fixed number of iterations.
* **Convergence threshold**: Stop the algorithm when the updates become smaller than a certain threshold.
* **Loss function threshold**: Stop the algorithm when the loss function reaches a certain threshold.

**Challenges and Limitations**
-----------------------------

Gradient descent has several challenges and limitations, including:

* **Local minima**: Gradient descent can get stuck in local minima, which are not the global minimum of the loss function.
* **Saddle points**: Gradient descent can get stuck in saddle points, which are points where the gradient is zero but the loss function is not at a minimum.
* **Non-convexity**: Gradient descent can struggle with non-convex loss functions, which have multiple local minima.

**Regularization Techniques**
-----------------------------

To address these challenges, several regularization techniques can be used, including:

* **L1 regularization**: Add a penalty term to the loss function to encourage sparse models.
* **L2 regularization**: Add a penalty term to the loss function to encourage small model weights.
* **Dropout**: Randomly drop out model weights during training to prevent overfitting.

**Conclusion**
==============

Gradient descent is a powerful algorithm for minimizing the loss function of a model. It is widely used in machine learning and optimization, and has many variants and extensions. However, it also has several challenges and limitations, including local minima, saddle points, and non-convexity. By understanding the mathematical background and challenges of gradient descent, we can better design and implement machine learning models that achieve good performance on a wide range of tasks.

```

Gradient descent is a fundamental concept in machine learning and optimization. It is an iterative algorithm used to minimize the loss function of a model, which is a measure of how well the model is performing on a given task. The goal of gradient descent is to find the optimal values of the model's parameters that result in the lowest possible loss.

**What is Gradient Descent?**
-----------------------------

Gradient descent is a first-order optimization algorithm, meaning it uses only the first derivative of the loss function to update the model's parameters. The algorithm works by iteratively adjusting the parameters in the direction of the negative gradient of the loss function.

4. **Learning Rate**: The learning rate is a hyperparameter that controls how quickly the model's parameters are updated during each iteration.

2. **Compute the Loss Function**: The loss function is computed using the current model parameters and the training data.
3. **Compute the Gradient**: The gradient of the loss function is computed using the current model parameters and the training data.
4. **Update the Model Parameters**: The model parameters are updated using the negative gradient and the learning rate. The update rule is as follows:

`w_new = w_old - learning_rate * gradient`

where `w_old` is the current value of the model parameter, `learning_rate` is the learning rate, and `gradient` is the gradient of the loss function.
5. **Repeat Steps 2-4**: Steps 2-4 are repeated until convergence or a stopping criterion is reached.

# Generate some sample data
y = np.random.rand(100)

# Train the model using gradient descent
for i in range(1000):
    # Compute the loss function
    loss = loss_function(x, y)
    
    # Compute the gradient
    grad = gradient(x, y)

Gradient descent converges when the loss function stops decreasing or reaches a minimum. However, in practice, convergence can be slow, and it's often necessary to use stopping criteria to terminate the algorithm. Common stopping criteria include:

1. **Maximum Number of Iterations**: Stop after a fixed number of iterations.
2. **Tolerance**: Stop when the loss function stops decreasing below a certain tolerance.
3. **Early Stopping**: Stop when the model's performance on a validation set starts to degrade.

Research in behavioral economics and psychology supports this idea. Many studies have shown that people tend to be loss-averse, meaning they prefer to avoid losses rather than acquiring gains. This is known as the ""loss aversion"" phenomenon, which is a key concept in prospect theory.

Additionally, the concept of ""diminishing marginal utility"" suggests that the value people place on additional gains decreases as their overall wealth or satisfaction increases. This means that the potential benefits of taking a risk to gain more may not outweigh the potential costs or losses, leading people to prefer the safer option.

Numerous studies in behavioral economics and psychology have confirmed that humans tend to be risk-averse, especially when it comes to gains. This is often referred to as ""loss aversion"" or ""risk aversion,"" and it is a fundamental aspect of human decision-making under uncertainty.

So, if the idiom ""A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush"" is true, it suggests that humans are indeed risk-averse, and this is consistent with a large body of empirical evidence from various fields.",247,0.898181818,275.000000055668

Right now, some nation-states and individual actors are intercepting and storing lots of encrypted data, like passwords, bank details, and social security numbers. But they can't open these files. So, why are they doing it? 

Well, because they believe that within the next 10 to 20 years, they will have access to a quantum computer that can break the encryption in minutes. This procedure is known as Store Now, Decrypt Later, or SNDL. It works because there is information available today that will still be valuable in a decade. 

Things like industrial and pharmaceutical research, and top-secret government intelligence, are all at risk, and everyone is aware of this threat. The National Security Administration says that a sufficiently large quantum computer, if built, would be capable of undermining all widely deployed public key algorithms. 

You know, in a five to ten year timeframe, quantum computing will break encryption as we know it today. 

Even though sufficiently powerful quantum computers are still years away...They're already a threat because of Store Now, Decrypt Later, which is why the US Congress just passed legislation mandating all agencies start transitioning right now to new methods of cryptography that can't be broken by quantum computers.

You know, our current encryption schemes have been remarkably successful, working effectively for over 40 years. Up until the 1970s, if you wanted to exchange private information with someone, you would first have to meet up in person and share a secret key. This same key would be used to encrypt and decrypt messages, so it's known as a symmetric key algorithm. As long as no one else gets their hands on the key, your messages are safe.

But now, what if you want to send information to someone you've never met, and it's too hard to arrange an in-person meeting? You can't share a key over an unsecured channel like a phone line or the mail, because it could be intercepted. 

This is what, in 1977, led three scientists—Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman—to develop a new approach.to come up with an encryption breakthrough. 

Today, it's known by their initials, RSA, and it works something like this: 

Every person has two really big prime numbers, all their own, which they keep secret. They multiply these numbers together to get an even bigger number, which they make public for everyone to see. 

Now, if I want to send someone a private message, I use their big public number to garble my message. I garble it in such a way that it is impossible to ungarble without knowing the two prime factors that made that number. 

This is an asymmetric key system, since different keys are used to encrypt and decrypt the message. So, it's easy for my intended recipient to decode, but impossible for everyone else, unless they can factor that large public number. 

Now, someone could try to factor it using a supercomputer. In the best-known factoring algorithm, the General Number Field Sieve, modern cryptography uses prime numbers that are around 313 digits long. Factoring a product of...If two primes are this big, even with a supercomputer, it would take around 16 million years. But not on a quantum computer.

See, in normal computers, a bit can only be in one state at a time, either a zero or a one. So, if you had two bits, they could be in one of four possible states: 00, 01, 10, or 11. Let's say each of these states represents a number: 0, 1, 2, or 3.

If we want to do a calculation, for example, raising seven to the power of one of these numbers, we can only do it for one state at a time. In this case, seven squared gives us the answer 49.

Quantum computers consist of qubits, which also have two states: zero or one. But unlike a classical bit, a qubit doesn't have to be in just one state at a time. It can be in an arbitrary combination of those states—a superposition, if you will—of zero and one. 

So, if you have two qubits, they can exist simultaneously in a superposition of 0, 1, 2, and 3. Now, when we repeat the same calculation, it will actually perform the calculation.for all of those numbers at the same time. 

And what we're left with is a superposition of the different answers: 1, 7, 49, and 343. 

If we add another qubit, we double the number of possible states. So with three qubits, we can represent eight states, and thus perform eight calculations all at once. 

Increase that number to just 20 qubits, and you can already represent over a million different states, meaning you can simultaneously compute over a million different answers. 

With 300 qubits, you can represent more states than there are particles in the observable universe. This sounds incredibly powerful, and it is, but there is one very big catch. 

All of the answers to the computation are embedded in a superposition of states, but you can't simply read out this superposition. When you make a measurement, you only get a single value from the superposition, basically at random, and all the other information is lost. 

So, in order to harness the power of a quantum computer, you need a smart way...to convert a superposition of states into one that contains only the information you want. This is an incredibly difficult task, which is why, for most applications, quantum computers are useless. 

So far, we've only identified a few problems where we can actually do this, but as luck would have it, these are precisely the problems that form the foundation of nearly all the public key cryptography we use today. 

In 1994, Peter Shor and Don Coppersmith figured out how to take a quantum Fourier transform. It works just like a normal Fourier transform: apply it to some periodic signal, and it returns the frequencies that are in that signal. 

Now, this may not seem particularly interesting, but consider this: if we have a superposition of states that is periodic, meaning the terms in the superposition are separated by some regular amount, we can apply the quantum Fourier transform and will be left with states that contain the frequency of the signal. 

So, this we can measure. The quantum F...Fourier transform allows us to extract frequency information from a periodic superposition, and that is going to come in handy.

So, how does a quantum computer factor the product of two primes much faster than a conventional computer? I want to explain this by first walking through a simple example with no quantum computer required, and then I'll show how a quantum computer could execute this method even for a very large number in a short period of time.

Let's say we have a number N, which is the product of two primes, p and q. For the sake of this example, let's set N equal to 77. Now, I bet you can guess the prime factors, but let's pretend for the moment that we don't know them, because with a product of really big primes, we wouldn't.

Now, I want to use a fact about numbers that feels like magic. Pick a number g that doesn't share any factors with N. If you multiply g by itself over and over and over, you will always eventually reach a multiple of N plus one. In other words, you can...Always find some exponent \( r \) such that \( g \) to the power of \( r \) is a multiple of \( N \) plus one. 

Let's see how this works. 

Pick any number that is smaller than 77. I'll pick the number eight. This number doesn't share factors with 77. If you were doing this with big primes, it would also be extremely unlikely that you just happen to pick a number that shares factors with \( N \). 

Now, multiply eight by itself once, twice, three times, four times, and so on, raising eight to ever higher powers. Then, divide each of these numbers by 77. We're not really interested in how many times 77 goes into the number, just the remainder—what's left over—because at some point, 77 should divide one of these numbers with a remainder of exactly one. 

So, eight divided by 77 is zero with a remainder of 8. Sixty-four divided by 77 is zero with a remainder of 64. Five hundred twelve divided by 77 is six with a remainder of 50. 

As we keep going, we get remainders of 15, 43, 36, 57, 71, 29, and finally one. 

So there we have it: eight to the power of 10 is...No more than a multiple of 77. 

So, we've found the exponent R that satisfies this equation. But how does this help find the factors of N? 

Well, we rearrange the equation to bring one over to the left-hand side, and then we can split it into two terms like so. 

Now, as long as R is even, we have one integer times another integer equal to a multiple of N. This looks remarkably similar to P times Q equals N. 

I mean, since we know that P and Q are on the right-hand side of this equation, they must also be on the left-hand side, just multiplied by some additional factors. 

One way to think about what we've done is that we've taken a bad guess for one of the factors, G, and by finding the exponent R, we've turned it into two much better guesses that probably do share factors with N. 

Since R was 10, the two terms on the left-hand side are eight to the power of five plus one, 32,769, and eight to the power of five minus one, 32,767. 

These two numbers probably share factors with N. So, how do we find...And them? 

We use Euclid's algorithm. 

If you want to find the greatest common divisor of two numbers, say 32,769 and 77, divide the bigger number by the smaller one and record the remainder. 

In this case, 32,769 divided by 77 gives a remainder of 44. Then, shift the numbers one position left and repeat. 

So now we divide 77 by 44, and we get a remainder of 33. Repeat the process again. 

44 divided by 33 gives a remainder of 11, and again, 33 divided by 11 equals 3 with a remainder of zero. 

When the remainder is zero, the divisor is the greatest common factor between the two numbers you started with. In this case, it's 11, which is indeed a factor of 77 and 32,769. 

You could do the same procedure with the other number or just divide 77 by 11 to get 7, its other prime factor. 

So to recap, if you want to find the prime factors p and q of a number N, first, make a bad guess, g. Second, find out how many times r you have to multiply g by itself to reach one more than a multiple of N. Third, use that expo...to calculate two new numbers that probably do share factors with N. 

And finally, use Euclid's algorithm to find the shared factors between those numbers and N, which should give you p and q. 

Now, you don't need a quantum computer to run any of these steps, but on a classical computer, this method wouldn't be any faster than other methods. 

The key process that a quantum computer speeds up is step two: finding the exponent you raise G2 to equal one more than a multiple of N. 

To see why, let's go back to our example, where eight to the power of 10 is one more than a multiple of 77. 

Watch what happens to the remainders if we keep going past eight to the power of 10, to eight to the 11, eight to the 12, and so on. 

Well, we get remainders of 8, 64, 50, 15, 43, 36, 57, 71, 29, and again one. 

The remainders cycle, and they will just keep cycling. 

Notice how the exponent that yields a remainder of one is 20, which is 10 more than the first exponent that yielded a remainder of one. 

So we know that...At eight to the 30 and eight to the 40, eight raised to any power divisible by 10 will also be one more than a multiple of 77. 

It's also worth noting that if you pick any remainder, say 15, the next time you find that same remainder, the exponent will have increased by 10. 

So, you can find the exponent R that gets us to one more than a multiple of n by looking at the spacing of any remainder, not just one. Remember that. 

Here, I'm plotting out the remainders on a log scale so you can see they are periodic with a period of 10. If I had made a different guess, say I had picked G equals 15 instead of eight, well then the period would be different and the remainders would be different, but there would always be a remainder of one. 

Why is this? Well, now that you can see this is a repeating pattern, we can go back to the beginning. Any number raised to the power of zero is one, so that is actually the first remainder. It must also appear when the cycle starts again. 

Now we are ready to use a...Quantum computer to factor any large product of two primes. 

First, we split up the qubits into two sets. The first set we prepare in a superposition of zero, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, and nine, all the way up to 10 to the power of 1,234. 

Yeah, this is a huge superposition, but if we had perfect qubits, it would require only around 4,100. The other set contains a similar number of qubits, all left in the zero state for now. 

Now we make our guess, G, which most likely doesn't share factors with N. We raise G to the power of the first set of qubits, then we divide by N and store the remainder in the second set of qubits, leaving the first set of qubits as it was. 

Now we have a superposition of all the numbers we started with and the remainder of raising G to the power of those numbers divided by N. Through this operation, we have entangled our two sets of qubits, but we can't just measure this superposition. If we did, we would get a random...Value and learn nothing. 

But there is a trick we can use. If we don't measure the entire superposition, but only the remainder part, we will obtain some random remainder. However, this remainder won't occur just once. It will occur multiple times, every time it comes up in the cycle. 

Imagine we were doing this with the example from before, with N equals 77 and G equals 8. If the remainder we measured was, say, 15, then there would be multiple terms in our superposition. This is because there are multiple exponents you can raise G to that give this same remainder: exponents 4, 14, 24, 34, and so on. They are each separated by 10, and that value is the exponent that satisfies our equation. 

More generally, after measuring the remainder, we will be left with a superposition of states that all share the same remainder, and the exponents will all be separated by the same amount, r. This is the number we are looking for. Since the remainder is now the same for all states, we can put it to the side, and we no...We have a superposition that is periodic. Each term is separated from its neighbors by an amount R. 

If we now apply the quantum Fourier transform to this superposition of states—and I'm simplifying a little here—we will be left with states containing one over R. 

So all that's left to do now is perform a measurement and find R by inverting it, and that's it for the quantum part. 

Now, as long as R turns out to be even, we can use R to turn our bad guess G into two numbers that likely share factors with N. As long as these terms themselves are not a multiple of N, we can use Euclid's algorithm to find the factors of N and break the encryption. 

This would only take several thousand perfect qubits, but the qubits we have today are imperfect, so we need additional qubits to act as redundant information. 

In 2012, it was estimated that it would take a billion physical qubits to break RSA encryption, but by five years later, that number had dropped to 230 million. 

And in 2019, after more tech...Technological breakthroughs have led to significant advancements in quantum computing. 

That estimate plummeted to just 20 million physical qubits. 

So, how many qubits do we have today? 

Well, if we look at the state of IBM's quantum computers, we are nowhere near that number of qubits, but progress looks to be exponential. 

So now it's just a question of when these two curves will collide before all our existing public key encryption can be broken. 

Because we've long known this threat is coming, scientists have been looking for new ways to encrypt data that can withstand attacks from both normal and quantum computers. 

In 2016, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, or NIST, launched a competition to find new encryption algorithms that aren't vulnerable to quantum computers. 

Cryptographers from all over the world submitted 82 different proposals, which were rigorously tested; some were broken. 

Then, on July 5th, 2022, NIST selected four of the algorithms to be part of their post-quantum cryptographic standard. 

So, how do they work? We...Well, three of the algorithms are based on the mathematics of lattices. 

So, let's do a simple example in the 2D plane. Take two vectors, r1 and r2. By adding together different integer combinations of these vectors, say three times r1 and one time r2, you can get two different points. All the points you can get by combining these two vectors in different ways is what is called a lattice. 

Now, I will also give you the point C, and your task is to tell me which combination of r1 and r2 will bring me to the lattice point closest to C. It's pretty easy to see that we can get there by going in the direction of r2 twice and in the negative direction of r1 twice. Simple enough. 

But those vectors, r1 and r2, are not the only vectors that can give you this lattice. Take b1 and b2, for example. These vectors also build up the same lattice. 

Now, if I ask you the same question again, can you tell me the combination of b1 and b2 that gets you to the lattice point closest to C? This has become a...lot harder, but why is that? 

Each time we're taking a step, we're trying to get closer in either the X or Y direction. However, with the b vectors, each time we take a step in the right direction with one vector, it puts us off in the other direction. That's why these vectors are a lot harder to work with. 

In the end, it takes us a combination of eight times b1 and negative six times b2 to get to the closest lattice point. That is a lot harder than before, but it's still a relatively easy problem to solve. 

If we extend it to three dimensions, this already becomes a lot harder, especially because you're not given the collection of all lattice points. You're only given the vectors that make it up. So, when you find a lattice point close to the target, you must still find all the other lattice points near it to make sure yours is indeed the closest. 

Let's take a circle of radius r in two dimensions. The number of lattice points inside the circle is proportional to r squared. Add a third...The dimension and the number of points in the sphere is proportional to \( r^3 \). 

So, just watch how the number of lattice points grows as we increase the number of dimensions. 

Solving the closest vector problem is a piece of cake for your computer in three dimensions. Even a hundred dimensions should be manageable. 

But in proposed future encryption schemes, we'll use around a thousand dimensions. Take one step in the right direction on one of those dimensions, and you could potentially be taking a wrong step in the other 999 dimensions. You win some, you lose everything else. 

With that many dimensions, it becomes extremely hard to find the closest point, even for the most powerful computers. That is, unless you know a good set of vectors. 

So, how do we use that to encrypt data? Well, let's go back to our two-dimensional example. Each person has a good set of vectors that describes a lattice, but they keep these vectors secret, and they only share their lattice publicly using a set of vectors.That is hard to work with. 

Now, if I want to send someone a message, I pick a point on their lattice. For example, say this point corresponds to the number seven. So, if I want to send the number seven, I can take that point but then add some random noise to it. 

The message I send is not precisely at that point, but close to it. Now, to decode the message, my recipient must figure out which lattice point is closest to the message point. In a thousand dimensions, this will be extremely hard to do unless you have the nice set of vectors, which my recipient does. 

So, it's easy for the recipient, who has the good vectors, but hard for everyone else. As far as we know, this problem is extremely difficult to solve for both normal and quantum computers. 

Behind the scenes, there's an army of researchers, mathematicians, and cryptographers who are going to make sure your secret data stays secret. These are some of the unsung heroes that will keep us safe moving forward, avoiding mass surveillance.by governments, keeping critical infrastructure protected and allowing you to live as if quantum computers were never invented in the first place.

Summarize the article in 1000 words.
","The article discusses the threat of quantum computers to current encryption methods and the efforts to develop new, quantum-resistant encryption algorithms. The threat arises from the ability of quantum computers to break certain types of encryption, specifically public key encryption, which is widely used to secure online transactions and communication. This is a concern because nation-states and individual actors are already intercepting and storing large amounts of encrypted data, such as passwords, bank details, and social security numbers, with the intention of decrypting them in the future when quantum computers become available.

The process of intercepting and storing encrypted data with the intention of decrypting it later is known as ""Store Now, Decrypt Later"" (SNDL). This is a threat because quantum computers can break certain types of encryption much faster than classical computers. In particular, the article mentions that a sufficiently large quantum computer could break all widely deployed public key algorithms, which would compromise the security of online transactions and communication.

The article explains that current encryption methods, such as RSA, rely on the difficulty of factoring large numbers. RSA works by using a pair of large prime numbers, p and q, to create a public key that can be used to encrypt messages. The recipient of the message uses the private key, which is derived from p and q, to decrypt the message. However, if an attacker can factor the public key, they can obtain the private key and decrypt the message.

The article explains how a quantum computer can be used to factor large numbers much faster than a classical computer. This is done using a quantum algorithm called Shor's algorithm, which is based on the quantum Fourier transform. The article provides a simplified explanation of how Shor's algorithm works, using a example to illustrate the process.

The article also discusses the efforts to develop new, quantum-resistant encryption algorithms. In 2016, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) launched a competition to find new encryption algorithms that are secure against both classical and quantum computers. The competition attracted 82 proposals from cryptographers around the world, and in 2022, NIST selected four algorithms to be part of their post-quantum cryptographic standard.

The article explains how three of the selected algorithms are based on the mathematics of lattices. Lattice-based cryptography uses a lattice, which is a set of points in a high-dimensional space, to create a public key that can be used to encrypt messages. The recipient of the message uses a secret lattice, which is related to the public lattice, to decrypt the message. The security of lattice-based cryptography relies on the difficulty of finding the closest point in the lattice to a given point, which is known as the ""closest vector problem"".

The article explains how the closest vector problem can be used to encrypt data. Each person has a secret lattice, which they use to create a public key. To send a message, the sender picks a point on the recipient's lattice and adds some random noise to it. The message is then sent to the recipient, who uses their secret lattice to find the closest point in the lattice to the message point. This process is easy for the recipient, who has the secret lattice, but hard for anyone else.

The article concludes by highlighting the importance of developing new, quantum-resistant encryption algorithms. The threat of quantum computers is real, and it is essential to have secure encryption methods in place to protect online transactions and communication. The article also mentions the role of companies like Brilliant, which is developing educational resources to help people learn about quantum computing and cryptography.

In addition to discussing the technical aspects of quantum computing and cryptography, the article also touches on the broader implications of these technologies. The article mentions that the development of quantum computers and AI chatbots will have a significant impact on our lives in the coming decades. It is essential to learn about these technologies and how they work, not just to understand the technical aspects but also to appreciate the broader implications.

The article also highlights the importance of statistical reasoning skills in mastering cryptography. Strong statistical reasoning skills are essential to finding patterns in data and making sense of them, which is crucial to mastering cryptography and other topics in math and computer science. The article mentions that Brilliant's course on data analysis can help people develop these skills, using everyday situations to illustrate key concepts in statistics.

Overall, the article provides a comprehensive overview of the threat of quantum computers to current encryption methods and the efforts to develop new, quantum-resistant encryption algorithms. It highlights the importance of understanding these technologies and how they work, not just to appreciate the technical aspects but also to appreciate the broader implications. The article also mentions the role of companies like Brilliant in developing educational resources to help people learn about these technologies.",943,13.496923923492432,69.86777174898616

This is an asymmetric key system, since different keys are used to encrypt and decrypt the message. So, it's easy for my intended recipient to decode, but impossible for everyone else, unless they can factor that large public number. 

Now, someone could try to factor it using a supercomputer. In the best-known factoring algorithm, the General Number Field Sieve, modern cryptography uses prime numbers that are around 313 digits long. Factoring a product of...If two primes are this big, even with a supercomputer, it would take around 16 million years. But not on a quantum computer.

See, in normal computers, a bit can only be in one state at a time, either a zero or a one. So, if you had two bits, they could be in one of four possible states: 00, 01, 10, or 11. Let's say each of these states represents a number: 0, 1, 2, or 3.

If we want to do a calculation, for example, raising seven to the power of one of these numbers, we can only do it for one state at a time. In this case, seven squared gives us the answer 49.

Quantum computers consist of qubits, which also have two states: zero or one. But unlike a classical bit, a qubit doesn't have to be in just one state at a time. It can be in an arbitrary combination of those states—a superposition, if you will—of zero and one. 

So, if you have two qubits, they can exist simultaneously in a superposition of 0, 1, 2, and 3. Now, when we repeat the same calculation, it will actually perform the calculation.for all of those numbers at the same time. 

And what we're left with is a superposition of the different answers: 1, 7, 49, and 343. 

If we add another qubit, we double the number of possible states. So with three qubits, we can represent eight states, and thus perform eight calculations all at once. 

Increase that number to just 20 qubits, and you can already represent over a million different states, meaning you can simultaneously compute over a million different answers. 

With 300 qubits, you can represent more states than there are particles in the observable universe. This sounds incredibly powerful, and it is, but there is one very big catch. 

All of the answers to the computation are embedded in a superposition of states, but you can't simply read out this superposition. When you make a measurement, you only get a single value from the superposition, basically at random, and all the other information is lost. 

So, in order to harness the power of a quantum computer, you need a smart way...to convert a superposition of states into one that contains only the information you want. This is an incredibly difficult task, which is why, for most applications, quantum computers are useless. 

So far, we've only identified a few problems where we can actually do this, but as luck would have it, these are precisely the problems that form the foundation of nearly all the public key cryptography we use today. 

In 1994, Peter Shor and Don Coppersmith figured out how to take a quantum Fourier transform. It works just like a normal Fourier transform: apply it to some periodic signal, and it returns the frequencies that are in that signal. 

Now, this may not seem particularly interesting, but consider this: if we have a superposition of states that is periodic, meaning the terms in the superposition are separated by some regular amount, we can apply the quantum Fourier transform and will be left with states that contain the frequency of the signal. 

So, this we can measure. The quantum F...Fourier transform allows us to extract frequency information from a periodic superposition, and that is going to come in handy.

So, how does a quantum computer factor the product of two primes much faster than a conventional computer? I want to explain this by first walking through a simple example with no quantum computer required, and then I'll show how a quantum computer could execute this method even for a very large number in a short period of time.

Let's say we have a number N, which is the product of two primes, p and q. For the sake of this example, let's set N equal to 77. Now, I bet you can guess the prime factors, but let's pretend for the moment that we don't know them, because with a product of really big primes, we wouldn't.

Now, I want to use a fact about numbers that feels like magic. Pick a number g that doesn't share any factors with N. If you multiply g by itself over and over and over, you will always eventually reach a multiple of N plus one. In other words, you can...Always find some exponent \( r \) such that \( g \) to the power of \( r \) is a multiple of \( N \) plus one. 

Let's see how this works. 

Pick any number that is smaller than 77. I'll pick the number eight. This number doesn't share factors with 77. If you were doing this with big primes, it would also be extremely unlikely that you just happen to pick a number that shares factors with \( N \). 

Now, multiply eight by itself once, twice, three times, four times, and so on, raising eight to ever higher powers. Then, divide each of these numbers by 77. We're not really interested in how many times 77 goes into the number, just the remainder—what's left over—because at some point, 77 should divide one of these numbers with a remainder of exactly one. 

So, eight divided by 77 is zero with a remainder of 8. Sixty-four divided by 77 is zero with a remainder of 64. Five hundred twelve divided by 77 is six with a remainder of 50. 

As we keep going, we get remainders of 15, 43, 36, 57, 71, 29, and finally one. 

So there we have it: eight to the power of 10 is...No more than a multiple of 77. 

So, we've found the exponent R that satisfies this equation. But how does this help find the factors of N? 

Well, we rearrange the equation to bring one over to the left-hand side, and then we can split it into two terms like so. 

Now, as long as R is even, we have one integer times another integer equal to a multiple of N. This looks remarkably similar to P times Q equals N. 

I mean, since we know that P and Q are on the right-hand side of this equation, they must also be on the left-hand side, just multiplied by some additional factors. 

One way to think about what we've done is that we've taken a bad guess for one of the factors, G, and by finding the exponent R, we've turned it into two much better guesses that probably do share factors with N. 

Since R was 10, the two terms on the left-hand side are eight to the power of five plus one, 32,769, and eight to the power of five minus one, 32,767. 

These two numbers probably share factors with N. So, how do we find...And them? 

We use Euclid's algorithm. 

If you want to find the greatest common divisor of two numbers, say 32,769 and 77, divide the bigger number by the smaller one and record the remainder. 

In this case, 32,769 divided by 77 gives a remainder of 44. Then, shift the numbers one position left and repeat. 

So now we divide 77 by 44, and we get a remainder of 33. Repeat the process again. 

44 divided by 33 gives a remainder of 11, and again, 33 divided by 11 equals 3 with a remainder of zero. 

When the remainder is zero, the divisor is the greatest common factor between the two numbers you started with. In this case, it's 11, which is indeed a factor of 77 and 32,769. 

You could do the same procedure with the other number or just divide 77 by 11 to get 7, its other prime factor. 

So to recap, if you want to find the prime factors p and q of a number N, first, make a bad guess, g. Second, find out how many times r you have to multiply g by itself to reach one more than a multiple of N. Third, use that expo...to calculate two new numbers that probably do share factors with N. 

And finally, use Euclid's algorithm to find the shared factors between those numbers and N, which should give you p and q. 

Now, you don't need a quantum computer to run any of these steps, but on a classical computer, this method wouldn't be any faster than other methods. 

The key process that a quantum computer speeds up is step two: finding the exponent you raise G2 to equal one more than a multiple of N. 

To see why, let's go back to our example, where eight to the power of 10 is one more than a multiple of 77. 

Watch what happens to the remainders if we keep going past eight to the power of 10, to eight to the 11, eight to the 12, and so on. 

Well, we get remainders of 8, 64, 50, 15, 43, 36, 57, 71, 29, and again one. 

The remainders cycle, and they will just keep cycling. 

Notice how the exponent that yields a remainder of one is 20, which is 10 more than the first exponent that yielded a remainder of one. 

So we know that...At eight to the 30 and eight to the 40, eight raised to any power divisible by 10 will also be one more than a multiple of 77. 

It's also worth noting that if you pick any remainder, say 15, the next time you find that same remainder, the exponent will have increased by 10. 

So, you can find the exponent R that gets us to one more than a multiple of n by looking at the spacing of any remainder, not just one. Remember that. 

Here, I'm plotting out the remainders on a log scale so you can see they are periodic with a period of 10. If I had made a different guess, say I had picked G equals 15 instead of eight, well then the period would be different and the remainders would be different, but there would always be a remainder of one. 

Why is this? Well, now that you can see this is a repeating pattern, we can go back to the beginning. Any number raised to the power of zero is one, so that is actually the first remainder. It must also appear when the cycle starts again. 

Now we are ready to use a...Quantum computer to factor any large product of two primes. 

First, we split up the qubits into two sets. The first set we prepare in a superposition of zero, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, and nine, all the way up to 10 to the power of 1,234. 

Yeah, this is a huge superposition, but if we had perfect qubits, it would require only around 4,100. The other set contains a similar number of qubits, all left in the zero state for now. 

Now we make our guess, G, which most likely doesn't share factors with N. We raise G to the power of the first set of qubits, then we divide by N and store the remainder in the second set of qubits, leaving the first set of qubits as it was. 

Now we have a superposition of all the numbers we started with and the remainder of raising G to the power of those numbers divided by N. Through this operation, we have entangled our two sets of qubits, but we can't just measure this superposition. If we did, we would get a random...Value and learn nothing. 

But there is a trick we can use. If we don't measure the entire superposition, but only the remainder part, we will obtain some random remainder. However, this remainder won't occur just once. It will occur multiple times, every time it comes up in the cycle. 

Imagine we were doing this with the example from before, with N equals 77 and G equals 8. If the remainder we measured was, say, 15, then there would be multiple terms in our superposition. This is because there are multiple exponents you can raise G to that give this same remainder: exponents 4, 14, 24, 34, and so on. They are each separated by 10, and that value is the exponent that satisfies our equation. 

More generally, after measuring the remainder, we will be left with a superposition of states that all share the same remainder, and the exponents will all be separated by the same amount, r. This is the number we are looking for. Since the remainder is now the same for all states, we can put it to the side, and we no...We have a superposition that is periodic. Each term is separated from its neighbors by an amount R. 

If we now apply the quantum Fourier transform to this superposition of states—and I'm simplifying a little here—we will be left with states containing one over R. 

So all that's left to do now is perform a measurement and find R by inverting it, and that's it for the quantum part. 

Now, as long as R turns out to be even, we can use R to turn our bad guess G into two numbers that likely share factors with N. As long as these terms themselves are not a multiple of N, we can use Euclid's algorithm to find the factors of N and break the encryption. 

This would only take several thousand perfect qubits, but the qubits we have today are imperfect, so we need additional qubits to act as redundant information. 

In 2012, it was estimated that it would take a billion physical qubits to break RSA encryption, but by five years later, that number had dropped to 230 million. 

And in 2019, after more tech...Technological breakthroughs have led to significant advancements in quantum computing. 

That estimate plummeted to just 20 million physical qubits. 

So, how many qubits do we have today? 

Well, if we look at the state of IBM's quantum computers, we are nowhere near that number of qubits, but progress looks to be exponential. 

So now it's just a question of when these two curves will collide before all our existing public key encryption can be broken. 

Because we've long known this threat is coming, scientists have been looking for new ways to encrypt data that can withstand attacks from both normal and quantum computers. 

In 2016, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, or NIST, launched a competition to find new encryption algorithms that aren't vulnerable to quantum computers. 

Cryptographers from all over the world submitted 82 different proposals, which were rigorously tested; some were broken. 

Then, on July 5th, 2022, NIST selected four of the algorithms to be part of their post-quantum cryptographic standard. 

So, how do they work? We...Well, three of the algorithms are based on the mathematics of lattices. 

So, let's do a simple example in the 2D plane. Take two vectors, r1 and r2. By adding together different integer combinations of these vectors, say three times r1 and one time r2, you can get two different points. All the points you can get by combining these two vectors in different ways is what is called a lattice. 

Now, I will also give you the point C, and your task is to tell me which combination of r1 and r2 will bring me to the lattice point closest to C. It's pretty easy to see that we can get there by going in the direction of r2 twice and in the negative direction of r1 twice. Simple enough. 

But those vectors, r1 and r2, are not the only vectors that can give you this lattice. Take b1 and b2, for example. These vectors also build up the same lattice. 

Now, if I ask you the same question again, can you tell me the combination of b1 and b2 that gets you to the lattice point closest to C? This has become a...lot harder, but why is that? 

Each time we're taking a step, we're trying to get closer in either the X or Y direction. However, with the b vectors, each time we take a step in the right direction with one vector, it puts us off in the other direction. That's why these vectors are a lot harder to work with. 

In the end, it takes us a combination of eight times b1 and negative six times b2 to get to the closest lattice point. That is a lot harder than before, but it's still a relatively easy problem to solve. 

If we extend it to three dimensions, this already becomes a lot harder, especially because you're not given the collection of all lattice points. You're only given the vectors that make it up. So, when you find a lattice point close to the target, you must still find all the other lattice points near it to make sure yours is indeed the closest. 

Let's take a circle of radius r in two dimensions. The number of lattice points inside the circle is proportional to r squared. Add a third...The dimension and the number of points in the sphere is proportional to \( r^3 \). 

So, just watch how the number of lattice points grows as we increase the number of dimensions. 

Solving the closest vector problem is a piece of cake for your computer in three dimensions. Even a hundred dimensions should be manageable. 

But in proposed future encryption schemes, we'll use around a thousand dimensions. Take one step in the right direction on one of those dimensions, and you could potentially be taking a wrong step in the other 999 dimensions. You win some, you lose everything else. 

With that many dimensions, it becomes extremely hard to find the closest point, even for the most powerful computers. That is, unless you know a good set of vectors. 

So, how do we use that to encrypt data? Well, let's go back to our two-dimensional example. Each person has a good set of vectors that describes a lattice, but they keep these vectors secret, and they only share their lattice publicly using a set of vectors.That is hard to work with. 

Now, if I want to send someone a message, I pick a point on their lattice. For example, say this point corresponds to the number seven. So, if I want to send the number seven, I can take that point but then add some random noise to it. 

The message I send is not precisely at that point, but close to it. Now, to decode the message, my recipient must figure out which lattice point is closest to the message point. In a thousand dimensions, this will be extremely hard to do unless you have the nice set of vectors, which my recipient does. 

So, it's easy for the recipient, who has the good vectors, but hard for everyone else. As far as we know, this problem is extremely difficult to solve for both normal and quantum computers. 

Behind the scenes, there's an army of researchers, mathematicians, and cryptographers who are going to make sure your secret data stays secret. These are some of the unsung heroes that will keep us safe moving forward, avoiding mass surveillance.by governments, keeping critical infrastructure protected and allowing you to live as if quantum computers were never invented in the first place.

Summarize the article in 1000 words.
","The article discusses the potential threat of quantum computers to current encryption methods and the efforts being made to develop new, quantum-resistant encryption algorithms. The threat arises from the fact that quantum computers can potentially break current encryption methods, such as RSA, much faster than classical computers. This is because quantum computers can perform certain calculations, such as factoring large numbers, exponentially faster than classical computers.

The article then delves into the details of how quantum computers can break current encryption methods. It explains that classical computers use bits, which can only be in one of two states, 0 or 1, to perform calculations. In contrast, quantum computers use qubits, which can exist in a superposition of both 0 and 1 at the same time. This allows quantum computers to perform certain calculations much faster than classical computers.

Right now, some nation-states and individual actors are intercepting and storing lots of encrypted data, like passwords, bank details, and social security numbers. But they can't open these files. So, why are they doing it? 

Well, because they believe that within the next 10 to 20 years, they will have access to a quantum computer that can break the encryption in minutes. This procedure is known as Store Now, Decrypt Later, or SNDL. It works because there is information available today that will still be valuable in a decade. 

Things like industrial and pharmaceutical research, and top-secret government intelligence, are all at risk, and everyone is aware of this threat. The National Security Administration says that a sufficiently large quantum computer, if built, would be capable of undermining all widely deployed public key algorithms. 

You know, in a five to ten year timeframe, quantum computing will break encryption as we know it today. 

Even though sufficiently powerful quantum computers are still years away...They're already a threat because of Store Now, Decrypt Later, which is why the US Congress just passed legislation mandating all agencies start transitioning right now to new methods of cryptography that can't be broken by quantum computers.

You know, our current encryption schemes have been remarkably successful, working effectively for over 40 years. Up until the 1970s, if you wanted to exchange private information with someone, you would first have to meet up in person and share a secret key. This same key would be used to encrypt and decrypt messages, so it's known as a symmetric key algorithm. As long as no one else gets their hands on the key, your messages are safe.

But now, what if you want to send information to someone you've never met, and it's too hard to arrange an in-person meeting? You can't share a key over an unsecured channel like a phone line or the mail, because it could be intercepted. 

This is what, in 1977, led three scientists—Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman—to develop a new approach.to come up with an encryption breakthrough. 

Today, it's known by their initials, RSA, and it works something like this: 

Every person has two really big prime numbers, all their own, which they keep secret. They multiply these numbers together to get an even bigger number, which they make public for everyone to see. 

Now, if I want to send someone a private message, I use their big public number to garble my message. I garble it in such a way that it is impossible to ungarble without knowing the two prime factors that made that number. 

This is an asymmetric key system, since different keys are used to encrypt and decrypt the message. So, it's easy for my intended recipient to decode, but impossible for everyone else, unless they can factor that large public number. 

Now, someone could try to factor it using a supercomputer. In the best-known factoring algorithm, the General Number Field Sieve, modern cryptography uses prime numbers that are around 313 digits long. Factoring a product of...If two primes are this big, even with a supercomputer, it would take around 16 million years. But not on a quantum computer.

See, in normal computers, a bit can only be in one state at a time, either a zero or a one. So, if you had two bits, they could be in one of four possible states: 00, 01, 10, or 11. Let's say each of these states represents a number: 0, 1, 2, or 3.

If we want to do a calculation, for example, raising seven to the power of one of these numbers, we can only do it for one state at a time. In this case, seven squared gives us the answer 49.

Quantum computers consist of qubits, which also have two states: zero or one. But unlike a classical bit, a qubit doesn't have to be in just one state at a time. It can be in an arbitrary combination of those states—a superposition, if you will—of zero and one. 

So, if you have two qubits, they can exist simultaneously in a superposition of 0, 1, 2, and 3. Now, when we repeat the same calculation, it will actually perform the calculation.for all of those numbers at the same time. 

And what we're left with is a superposition of the different answers: 1, 7, 49, and 343. 

If we add another qubit, we double the number of possible states. So with three qubits, we can represent eight states, and thus perform eight calculations all at once. 

Increase that number to just 20 qubits, and you can already represent over a million different states, meaning you can simultaneously compute over a million different answers. 

With 300 qubits, you can represent more states than there are particles in the observable universe. This sounds incredibly powerful, and it is, but there is one very big catch. 

All of the answers to the computation are embedded in a superposition of states, but you can't simply read out this superposition. When you make a measurement, you only get a single value from the superposition, basically at random, and all the other information is lost. 

So, in order to harness the power of a quantum computer, you need a smart way...to convert a superposition of states into one that contains only the information you want. This is an incredibly difficult task, which is why, for most applications, quantum computers are useless. 

So far, we've only identified a few problems where we can actually do this, but as luck would have it, these are precisely the problems that form the foundation of nearly all the public key cryptography we use today. 

In 1994, Peter Shor and Don Coppersmith figured out how to take a quantum Fourier transform. It works just like a normal Fourier transform: apply it to some periodic signal, and it returns the frequencies that are in that signal. 

Now, this may not seem particularly interesting, but consider this: if we have a superposition of states that is periodic, meaning the terms in the superposition are separated by some regular amount, we can apply the quantum Fourier transform and will be left with states that contain the frequency of the signal. 

So, this we can measure. The quantum F...Fourier transform allows us to extract frequency information from a periodic superposition, and that is going to come in handy.

So, how does a quantum computer factor the product of two primes much faster than a conventional computer? I want to explain this by first walking through a simple example with no quantum computer required, and then I'll show how a quantum computer could execute this method even for a very large number in a short period of time.

Let's say we have a number N, which is the product of two primes, p and q. For the sake of this example, let's set N equal to 77. Now, I bet you can guess the prime factors, but let's pretend for the moment that we don't know them, because with a product of really big primes, we wouldn't.

Now, I want to use a fact about numbers that feels like magic. Pick a number g that doesn't share any factors with N. If you multiply g by itself over and over and over, you will always eventually reach a multiple of N plus one. In other words, you can...Always find some exponent \( r \) such that \( g \) to the power of \( r \) is a multiple of \( N \) plus one. 

Let's see how this works. 

Pick any number that is smaller than 77. I'll pick the number eight. This number doesn't share factors with 77. If you were doing this with big primes, it would also be extremely unlikely that you just happen to pick a number that shares factors with \( N \). 

Now, multiply eight by itself once, twice, three times, four times, and so on, raising eight to ever higher powers. Then, divide each of these numbers by 77. We're not really interested in how many times 77 goes into the number, just the remainder—what's left over—because at some point, 77 should divide one of these numbers with a remainder of exactly one. 

So, eight divided by 77 is zero with a remainder of 8. Sixty-four divided by 77 is zero with a remainder of 64. Five hundred twelve divided by 77 is six with a remainder of 50. 

As we keep going, we get remainders of 15, 43, 36, 57, 71, 29, and finally one. 

So there we have it: eight to the power of 10 is...No more than a multiple of 77. 

So, we've found the exponent R that satisfies this equation. But how does this help find the factors of N? 

Well, we rearrange the equation to bring one over to the left-hand side, and then we can split it into two terms like so. 

Now, as long as R is even, we have one integer times another integer equal to a multiple of N. This looks remarkably similar to P times Q equals N. 

I mean, since we know that P and Q are on the right-hand side of this equation, they must also be on the left-hand side, just multiplied by some additional factors. 

One way to think about what we've done is that we've taken a bad guess for one of the factors, G, and by finding the exponent R, we've turned it into two much better guesses that probably do share factors with N. 

Since R was 10, the two terms on the left-hand side are eight to the power of five plus one, 32,769, and eight to the power of five minus one, 32,767. 

These two numbers probably share factors with N. So, how do we find...And them? 

We use Euclid's algorithm. 

If you want to find the greatest common divisor of two numbers, say 32,769 and 77, divide the bigger number by the smaller one and record the remainder. 

In this case, 32,769 divided by 77 gives a remainder of 44. Then, shift the numbers one position left and repeat. 

So now we divide 77 by 44, and we get a remainder of 33. Repeat the process again. 

44 divided by 33 gives a remainder of 11, and again, 33 divided by 11 equals 3 with a remainder of zero. 

When the remainder is zero, the divisor is the greatest common factor between the two numbers you started with. In this case, it's 11, which is indeed a factor of 77 and 32,769. 

You could do the same procedure with the other number or just divide 77 by 11 to get 7, its other prime factor. 

So to recap, if you want to find the prime factors p and q of a number N, first, make a bad guess, g. Second, find out how many times r you have to multiply g by itself to reach one more than a multiple of N. Third, use that expo...to calculate two new numbers that probably do share factors with N. 

And finally, use Euclid's algorithm to find the shared factors between those numbers and N, which should give you p and q. 

Now, you don't need a quantum computer to run any of these steps, but on a classical computer, this method wouldn't be any faster than other methods. 

The key process that a quantum computer speeds up is step two: finding the exponent you raise G2 to equal one more than a multiple of N. 

To see why, let's go back to our example, where eight to the power of 10 is one more than a multiple of 77. 

Watch what happens to the remainders if we keep going past eight to the power of 10, to eight to the 11, eight to the 12, and so on. 

Well, we get remainders of 8, 64, 50, 15, 43, 36, 57, 71, 29, and again one. 

The remainders cycle, and they will just keep cycling. 

Notice how the exponent that yields a remainder of one is 20, which is 10 more than the first exponent that yielded a remainder of one. 

So we know that...At eight to the 30 and eight to the 40, eight raised to any power divisible by 10 will also be one more than a multiple of 77. 

It's also worth noting that if you pick any remainder, say 15, the next time you find that same remainder, the exponent will have increased by 10. 

So, you can find the exponent R that gets us to one more than a multiple of n by looking at the spacing of any remainder, not just one. Remember that. 

Here, I'm plotting out the remainders on a log scale so you can see they are periodic with a period of 10. If I had made a different guess, say I had picked G equals 15 instead of eight, well then the period would be different and the remainders would be different, but there would always be a remainder of one. 

Why is this? Well, now that you can see this is a repeating pattern, we can go back to the beginning. Any number raised to the power of zero is one, so that is actually the first remainder. It must also appear when the cycle starts again. 

Now we are ready to use a...Quantum computer to factor any large product of two primes. 

First, we split up the qubits into two sets. The first set we prepare in a superposition of zero, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, and nine, all the way up to 10 to the power of 1,234. 

Yeah, this is a huge superposition, but if we had perfect qubits, it would require only around 4,100. The other set contains a similar number of qubits, all left in the zero state for now. 

Now we make our guess, G, which most likely doesn't share factors with N. We raise G to the power of the first set of qubits, then we divide by N and store the remainder in the second set of qubits, leaving the first set of qubits as it was. 

Now we have a superposition of all the numbers we started with and the remainder of raising G to the power of those numbers divided by N. Through this operation, we have entangled our two sets of qubits, but we can't just measure this superposition. If we did, we would get a random...Value and learn nothing. 

But there is a trick we can use. If we don't measure the entire superposition, but only the remainder part, we will obtain some random remainder. However, this remainder won't occur just once. It will occur multiple times, every time it comes up in the cycle. 

Imagine we were doing this with the example from before, with N equals 77 and G equals 8. If the remainder we measured was, say, 15, then there would be multiple terms in our superposition. This is because there are multiple exponents you can raise G to that give this same remainder: exponents 4, 14, 24, 34, and so on. They are each separated by 10, and that value is the exponent that satisfies our equation. 

More generally, after measuring the remainder, we will be left with a superposition of states that all share the same remainder, and the exponents will all be separated by the same amount, r. This is the number we are looking for. Since the remainder is now the same for all states, we can put it to the side, and we no...We have a superposition that is periodic. Each term is separated from its neighbors by an amount R. 

If we now apply the quantum Fourier transform to this superposition of states—and I'm simplifying a little here—we will be left with states containing one over R. 

So all that's left to do now is perform a measurement and find R by inverting it, and that's it for the quantum part. 

Now, as long as R turns out to be even, we can use R to turn our bad guess G into two numbers that likely share factors with N. As long as these terms themselves are not a multiple of N, we can use Euclid's algorithm to find the factors of N and break the encryption. 

This would only take several thousand perfect qubits, but the qubits we have today are imperfect, so we need additional qubits to act as redundant information. 

In 2012, it was estimated that it would take a billion physical qubits to break RSA encryption, but by five years later, that number had dropped to 230 million. 

And in 2019, after more tech...Technological breakthroughs have led to significant advancements in quantum computing. 

That estimate plummeted to just 20 million physical qubits. 

So, how many qubits do we have today? 

Well, if we look at the state of IBM's quantum computers, we are nowhere near that number of qubits, but progress looks to be exponential. 

So now it's just a question of when these two curves will collide before all our existing public key encryption can be broken. 

Because we've long known this threat is coming, scientists have been looking for new ways to encrypt data that can withstand attacks from both normal and quantum computers. 

In 2016, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, or NIST, launched a competition to find new encryption algorithms that aren't vulnerable to quantum computers. 

Cryptographers from all over the world submitted 82 different proposals, which were rigorously tested; some were broken. 

Then, on July 5th, 2022, NIST selected four of the algorithms to be part of their post-quantum cryptographic standard. 

So, how do they work? We...Well, three of the algorithms are based on the mathematics of lattices. 

So, let's do a simple example in the 2D plane. Take two vectors, r1 and r2. By adding together different integer combinations of these vectors, say three times r1 and one time r2, you can get two different points. All the points you can get by combining these two vectors in different ways is what is called a lattice. 

Now, I will also give you the point C, and your task is to tell me which combination of r1 and r2 will bring me to the lattice point closest to C. It's pretty easy to see that we can get there by going in the direction of r2 twice and in the negative direction of r1 twice. Simple enough. 

But those vectors, r1 and r2, are not the only vectors that can give you this lattice. Take b1 and b2, for example. These vectors also build up the same lattice. 

Now, if I ask you the same question again, can you tell me the combination of b1 and b2 that gets you to the lattice point closest to C? This has become a...lot harder, but why is that? 

Each time we're taking a step, we're trying to get closer in either the X or Y direction. However, with the b vectors, each time we take a step in the right direction with one vector, it puts us off in the other direction. That's why these vectors are a lot harder to work with. 

In the end, it takes us a combination of eight times b1 and negative six times b2 to get to the closest lattice point. That is a lot harder than before, but it's still a relatively easy problem to solve. 

If we extend it to three dimensions, this already becomes a lot harder, especially because you're not given the collection of all lattice points. You're only given the vectors that make it up. So, when you find a lattice point close to the target, you must still find all the other lattice points near it to make sure yours is indeed the closest. 

Let's take a circle of radius r in two dimensions. The number of lattice points inside the circle is proportional to r squared. Add a third...The dimension and the number of points in the sphere is proportional to \( r^3 \). 

So, just watch how the number of lattice points grows as we increase the number of dimensions. 

Solving the closest vector problem is a piece of cake for your computer in three dimensions. Even a hundred dimensions should be manageable. 

But in proposed future encryption schemes, we'll use around a thousand dimensions. Take one step in the right direction on one of those dimensions, and you could potentially be taking a wrong step in the other 999 dimensions. You win some, you lose everything else. 

With that many dimensions, it becomes extremely hard to find the closest point, even for the most powerful computers. That is, unless you know a good set of vectors. 

So, how do we use that to encrypt data? Well, let's go back to our two-dimensional example. Each person has a good set of vectors that describes a lattice, but they keep these vectors secret, and they only share their lattice publicly using a set of vectors.That is hard to work with. 

Now, if I want to send someone a message, I pick a point on their lattice. For example, say this point corresponds to the number seven. So, if I want to send the number seven, I can take that point but then add some random noise to it. 

The message I send is not precisely at that point, but close to it. Now, to decode the message, my recipient must figure out which lattice point is closest to the message point. In a thousand dimensions, this will be extremely hard to do unless you have the nice set of vectors, which my recipient does. 

So, it's easy for the recipient, who has the good vectors, but hard for everyone else. As far as we know, this problem is extremely difficult to solve for both normal and quantum computers. 

Behind the scenes, there's an army of researchers, mathematicians, and cryptographers who are going to make sure your secret data stays secret. These are some of the unsung heroes that will keep us safe moving forward, avoiding mass surveillance.by governments, keeping critical infrastructure protected and allowing you to live as if quantum computers were never invented in the first place.

Summarize the article in 1000 words.
","The threat of quantum computers to current encryption methods is a pressing concern. Nation-states and individual actors are collecting and storing vast amounts of encrypted data, including sensitive information like passwords, bank details, and social security numbers. Although they cannot currently access this data due to encryption, they are doing so in anticipation of developing quantum computers that can break the encryption in the near future. This approach is known as ""Store Now, Decrypt Later"" (SNDL).

The reason for this threat is that quantum computers have the potential to break current encryption methods, which have been successful for over 40 years. The current encryption methods, such as RSA, rely on the difficulty of factoring large numbers into their prime factors. However, quantum computers can use a quantum algorithm called Shor's algorithm to factor large numbers exponentially faster than classical computers.

The RSA encryption method works by using a pair of large prime numbers to create a public and private key. The public key is used to encrypt the data, and the private key is used to decrypt it. However, if an attacker can factor the large number created by multiplying the two prime numbers, they can obtain the private key and decrypt the data.

Quantum computers can break RSA encryption using Shor's algorithm, which works by creating a superposition of all possible states of a quantum register and then applying a quantum Fourier transform to extract the period of the function. This period is then used to find the factors of the large number.

To understand how Shor's algorithm works, consider a simple example. Suppose we want to factor a large number N, which is the product of two prime numbers p and q. We can use a bad guess, g, which does not share any factors with N. We then raise g to the power of r, where r is an exponent that satisfies the equation g^r = 1 mod N. This equation means that g raised to the power of r is congruent to 1 modulo N.

To find the exponent r, we can use a classical computer to iterate through all possible values of r until we find one that satisfies the equation. However, this approach is impractical for large numbers, as the number of possible values of r is exponentially large.

A quantum computer can solve this problem more efficiently by creating a superposition of all possible states of a quantum register and then applying a quantum Fourier transform to extract the period of the function. This period is then used to find the factors of the large number.

The process of using a quantum computer to factor a large number involves several steps. First, we prepare a quantum register in a superposition of all possible states. We then apply a unitary transformation to the register, which corresponds to the function g^x mod N. This transformation creates a superposition of all possible values of g^x mod N.

Next, we apply a quantum Fourier transform to the register, which extracts the period of the function. The period is then used to find the factors of the large number. Finally, we measure the register to obtain the factors of the large number.

The development of quantum computers that can break current encryption methods is a significant threat to global security. To address this threat, researchers are working on developing new encryption methods that are resistant to quantum computer attacks. One such approach is to use lattice-based cryptography, which relies on the hardness of problems related to lattices.

Lattices are geometric objects that can be used to represent complex mathematical structures. In lattice-based cryptography, the plaintext message is encoded as a lattice point, and the ciphertext is obtained by adding noise to the lattice point. The recipient can then use their private key to remove the noise and recover the original lattice point.

Lattice-based cryptography is considered to be secure against quantum computer attacks because the problems related to lattices are hard for both classical and quantum computers to solve. The most well-known problem related to lattices is the shortest vector problem, which involves finding the shortest non-zero vector in a lattice.

To break lattice-based cryptography, an attacker would need to solve the shortest vector problem, which is considered to be hard for both classical and quantum computers. However, researchers are working on developing more efficient algorithms for solving lattice problems, and it is possible that a breakthrough could be made in the future.

In addition to lattice-based cryptography, researchers are also working on developing other types of post-quantum cryptography, such as code-based cryptography and hash-based signatures. These approaches rely on different mathematical problems that are considered to be hard for both classical and quantum computers to solve.

The development of post-quantum cryptography is an active area of research, and several organizations, including the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), are working on developing standards for post-quantum cryptography. In 2016, NIST launched a competition to develop new encryption algorithms that are resistant to quantum computer attacks, and several finalists have been selected for further evaluation.

In conclusion, the threat of quantum computers to current encryption methods is a pressing concern, and researchers are working on developing new encryption methods that are resistant to quantum computer attacks. Lattice-based cryptography is one such approach, which relies on the hardness of problems related to lattices. While the development of post-quantum cryptography is an active area of research, it is essential to develop new encryption methods that can withstand the power of quantum computers.

To learn more about quantum algorithms and cryptography, one can use online resources such as Brilliant, which offers interactive lessons and exercises on these topics. Brilliant's course on quantum algorithms, co-developed with Microsoft and Alphabet X, provides a comprehensive introduction to quantum computing and quantum algorithms. The course includes interactive simulations and exercises that allow learners to write and execute real quantum algorithms.

In addition to quantum algorithms, Brilliant also offers courses on data analysis and statistics, which are essential skills for working with data and developing machine learning models. The course on data analysis provides interactive lessons and exercises on topics such as data visualization, regression analysis, and hypothesis testing.

Overall, the development of quantum computers and post-quantum cryptography is an exciting and rapidly evolving field. While the threat of quantum computers to current encryption methods is a pressing concern, researchers are working on developing new encryption methods that are resistant to quantum computer attacks. By learning about quantum algorithms and cryptography, one can gain a deeper understanding of the underlying mathematics and develop skills that are essential for working in this field.",1292,4.698181818,275.0000000106424

Right now, some nation-states and individual actors are intercepting and storing lots of encrypted data, like passwords, bank details, and social security numbers. But they can't open these files. So, why are they doing it? 

Well, because they believe that within the next 10 to 20 years, they will have access to a quantum computer that can break the encryption in minutes. This procedure is known as Store Now, Decrypt Later, or SNDL. It works because there is information available today that will still be valuable in a decade. 

Things like industrial and pharmaceutical research, and top-secret government intelligence, are all at risk, and everyone is aware of this threat. The National Security Administration says that a sufficiently large quantum computer, if built, would be capable of undermining all widely deployed public key algorithms. 

You know, in a five to ten year timeframe, quantum computing will break encryption as we know it today. 

Even though sufficiently powerful quantum computers are still years away...They're already a threat because of Store Now, Decrypt Later, which is why the US Congress just passed legislation mandating all agencies start transitioning right now to new methods of cryptography that can't be broken by quantum computers.

You know, our current encryption schemes have been remarkably successful, working effectively for over 40 years. Up until the 1970s, if you wanted to exchange private information with someone, you would first have to meet up in person and share a secret key. This same key would be used to encrypt and decrypt messages, so it's known as a symmetric key algorithm. As long as no one else gets their hands on the key, your messages are safe.

But now, what if you want to send information to someone you've never met, and it's too hard to arrange an in-person meeting? You can't share a key over an unsecured channel like a phone line or the mail, because it could be intercepted. 

This is what, in 1977, led three scientists—Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman—to develop a new approach.to come up with an encryption breakthrough. 

Today, it's known by their initials, RSA, and it works something like this: 

Every person has two really big prime numbers, all their own, which they keep secret. They multiply these numbers together to get an even bigger number, which they make public for everyone to see. 

Now, if I want to send someone a private message, I use their big public number to garble my message. I garble it in such a way that it is impossible to ungarble without knowing the two prime factors that made that number. 

This is an asymmetric key system, since different keys are used to encrypt and decrypt the message. So, it's easy for my intended recipient to decode, but impossible for everyone else, unless they can factor that large public number. 

Now, someone could try to factor it using a supercomputer. In the best-known factoring algorithm, the General Number Field Sieve, modern cryptography uses prime numbers that are around 313 digits long. Factoring a product of...If two primes are this big, even with a supercomputer, it would take around 16 million years. But not on a quantum computer.

See, in normal computers, a bit can only be in one state at a time, either a zero or a one. So, if you had two bits, they could be in one of four possible states: 00, 01, 10, or 11. Let's say each of these states represents a number: 0, 1, 2, or 3.

If we want to do a calculation, for example, raising seven to the power of one of these numbers, we can only do it for one state at a time. In this case, seven squared gives us the answer 49.

Quantum computers consist of qubits, which also have two states: zero or one. But unlike a classical bit, a qubit doesn't have to be in just one state at a time. It can be in an arbitrary combination of those states—a superposition, if you will—of zero and one. 

So, if you have two qubits, they can exist simultaneously in a superposition of 0, 1, 2, and 3. Now, when we repeat the same calculation, it will actually perform the calculation.for all of those numbers at the same time. 

And what we're left with is a superposition of the different answers: 1, 7, 49, and 343. 

If we add another qubit, we double the number of possible states. So with three qubits, we can represent eight states, and thus perform eight calculations all at once. 

Increase that number to just 20 qubits, and you can already represent over a million different states, meaning you can simultaneously compute over a million different answers. 

With 300 qubits, you can represent more states than there are particles in the observable universe. This sounds incredibly powerful, and it is, but there is one very big catch. 

All of the answers to the computation are embedded in a superposition of states, but you can't simply read out this superposition. When you make a measurement, you only get a single value from the superposition, basically at random, and all the other information is lost. 

So, in order to harness the power of a quantum computer, you need a smart way...to convert a superposition of states into one that contains only the information you want. This is an incredibly difficult task, which is why, for most applications, quantum computers are useless. 

So far, we've only identified a few problems where we can actually do this, but as luck would have it, these are precisely the problems that form the foundation of nearly all the public key cryptography we use today. 

In 1994, Peter Shor and Don Coppersmith figured out how to take a quantum Fourier transform. It works just like a normal Fourier transform: apply it to some periodic signal, and it returns the frequencies that are in that signal. 

Now, this may not seem particularly interesting, but consider this: if we have a superposition of states that is periodic, meaning the terms in the superposition are separated by some regular amount, we can apply the quantum Fourier transform and will be left with states that contain the frequency of the signal. 

So, this we can measure. The quantum F...Fourier transform allows us to extract frequency information from a periodic superposition, and that is going to come in handy.

So, how does a quantum computer factor the product of two primes much faster than a conventional computer? I want to explain this by first walking through a simple example with no quantum computer required, and then I'll show how a quantum computer could execute this method even for a very large number in a short period of time.

Let's say we have a number N, which is the product of two primes, p and q. For the sake of this example, let's set N equal to 77. Now, I bet you can guess the prime factors, but let's pretend for the moment that we don't know them, because with a product of really big primes, we wouldn't.

Now, I want to use a fact about numbers that feels like magic. Pick a number g that doesn't share any factors with N. If you multiply g by itself over and over and over, you will always eventually reach a multiple of N plus one. In other words, you can...Always find some exponent \( r \) such that \( g \) to the power of \( r \) is a multiple of \( N \) plus one. 

Let's see how this works. 

Pick any number that is smaller than 77. I'll pick the number eight. This number doesn't share factors with 77. If you were doing this with big primes, it would also be extremely unlikely that you just happen to pick a number that shares factors with \( N \). 

Now, multiply eight by itself once, twice, three times, four times, and so on, raising eight to ever higher powers. Then, divide each of these numbers by 77. We're not really interested in how many times 77 goes into the number, just the remainder—what's left over—because at some point, 77 should divide one of these numbers with a remainder of exactly one. 

So, eight divided by 77 is zero with a remainder of 8. Sixty-four divided by 77 is zero with a remainder of 64. Five hundred twelve divided by 77 is six with a remainder of 50. 

As we keep going, we get remainders of 15, 43, 36, 57, 71, 29, and finally one. 

So there we have it: eight to the power of 10 is...No more than a multiple of 77. 

So, we've found the exponent R that satisfies this equation. But how does this help find the factors of N? 

Well, we rearrange the equation to bring one over to the left-hand side, and then we can split it into two terms like so. 

Now, as long as R is even, we have one integer times another integer equal to a multiple of N. This looks remarkably similar to P times Q equals N. 

I mean, since we know that P and Q are on the right-hand side of this equation, they must also be on the left-hand side, just multiplied by some additional factors. 

One way to think about what we've done is that we've taken a bad guess for one of the factors, G, and by finding the exponent R, we've turned it into two much better guesses that probably do share factors with N. 

Since R was 10, the two terms on the left-hand side are eight to the power of five plus one, 32,769, and eight to the power of five minus one, 32,767. 

These two numbers probably share factors with N. So, how do we find...And them? 

We use Euclid's algorithm. 

If you want to find the greatest common divisor of two numbers, say 32,769 and 77, divide the bigger number by the smaller one and record the remainder. 

In this case, 32,769 divided by 77 gives a remainder of 44. Then, shift the numbers one position left and repeat. 

So now we divide 77 by 44, and we get a remainder of 33. Repeat the process again. 

44 divided by 33 gives a remainder of 11, and again, 33 divided by 11 equals 3 with a remainder of zero. 

When the remainder is zero, the divisor is the greatest common factor between the two numbers you started with. In this case, it's 11, which is indeed a factor of 77 and 32,769. 

You could do the same procedure with the other number or just divide 77 by 11 to get 7, its other prime factor. 

So to recap, if you want to find the prime factors p and q of a number N, first, make a bad guess, g. Second, find out how many times r you have to multiply g by itself to reach one more than a multiple of N. Third, use that expo...to calculate two new numbers that probably do share factors with N. 

And finally, use Euclid's algorithm to find the shared factors between those numbers and N, which should give you p and q. 

Now, you don't need a quantum computer to run any of these steps, but on a classical computer, this method wouldn't be any faster than other methods. 

The key process that a quantum computer speeds up is step two: finding the exponent you raise G2 to equal one more than a multiple of N. 

To see why, let's go back to our example, where eight to the power of 10 is one more than a multiple of 77. 

Watch what happens to the remainders if we keep going past eight to the power of 10, to eight to the 11, eight to the 12, and so on. 

Well, we get remainders of 8, 64, 50, 15, 43, 36, 57, 71, 29, and again one. 

The remainders cycle, and they will just keep cycling. 

Notice how the exponent that yields a remainder of one is 20, which is 10 more than the first exponent that yielded a remainder of one. 

So we know that...At eight to the 30 and eight to the 40, eight raised to any power divisible by 10 will also be one more than a multiple of 77. 

It's also worth noting that if you pick any remainder, say 15, the next time you find that same remainder, the exponent will have increased by 10. 

So, you can find the exponent R that gets us to one more than a multiple of n by looking at the spacing of any remainder, not just one. Remember that. 

Here, I'm plotting out the remainders on a log scale so you can see they are periodic with a period of 10. If I had made a different guess, say I had picked G equals 15 instead of eight, well then the period would be different and the remainders would be different, but there would always be a remainder of one. 

Why is this? Well, now that you can see this is a repeating pattern, we can go back to the beginning. Any number raised to the power of zero is one, so that is actually the first remainder. It must also appear when the cycle starts again. 

Now we are ready to use a...Quantum computer to factor any large product of two primes. 

First, we split up the qubits into two sets. The first set we prepare in a superposition of zero, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, and nine, all the way up to 10 to the power of 1,234. 

Yeah, this is a huge superposition, but if we had perfect qubits, it would require only around 4,100. The other set contains a similar number of qubits, all left in the zero state for now. 

Now we make our guess, G, which most likely doesn't share factors with N. We raise G to the power of the first set of qubits, then we divide by N and store the remainder in the second set of qubits, leaving the first set of qubits as it was. 

Now we have a superposition of all the numbers we started with and the remainder of raising G to the power of those numbers divided by N. Through this operation, we have entangled our two sets of qubits, but we can't just measure this superposition. If we did, we would get a random...Value and learn nothing. 

But there is a trick we can use. If we don't measure the entire superposition, but only the remainder part, we will obtain some random remainder. However, this remainder won't occur just once. It will occur multiple times, every time it comes up in the cycle. 

Imagine we were doing this with the example from before, with N equals 77 and G equals 8. If the remainder we measured was, say, 15, then there would be multiple terms in our superposition. This is because there are multiple exponents you can raise G to that give this same remainder: exponents 4, 14, 24, 34, and so on. They are each separated by 10, and that value is the exponent that satisfies our equation. 

More generally, after measuring the remainder, we will be left with a superposition of states that all share the same remainder, and the exponents will all be separated by the same amount, r. This is the number we are looking for. Since the remainder is now the same for all states, we can put it to the side, and we no...We have a superposition that is periodic. Each term is separated from its neighbors by an amount R. 

If we now apply the quantum Fourier transform to this superposition of states—and I'm simplifying a little here—we will be left with states containing one over R. 

So all that's left to do now is perform a measurement and find R by inverting it, and that's it for the quantum part. 

Now, as long as R turns out to be even, we can use R to turn our bad guess G into two numbers that likely share factors with N. As long as these terms themselves are not a multiple of N, we can use Euclid's algorithm to find the factors of N and break the encryption. 

This would only take several thousand perfect qubits, but the qubits we have today are imperfect, so we need additional qubits to act as redundant information. 

In 2012, it was estimated that it would take a billion physical qubits to break RSA encryption, but by five years later, that number had dropped to 230 million. 

And in 2019, after more tech...Technological breakthroughs have led to significant advancements in quantum computing. 

That estimate plummeted to just 20 million physical qubits. 

So, how many qubits do we have today? 

Well, if we look at the state of IBM's quantum computers, we are nowhere near that number of qubits, but progress looks to be exponential. 

So now it's just a question of when these two curves will collide before all our existing public key encryption can be broken. 

Because we've long known this threat is coming, scientists have been looking for new ways to encrypt data that can withstand attacks from both normal and quantum computers. 

In 2016, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, or NIST, launched a competition to find new encryption algorithms that aren't vulnerable to quantum computers. 

Cryptographers from all over the world submitted 82 different proposals, which were rigorously tested; some were broken. 

Then, on July 5th, 2022, NIST selected four of the algorithms to be part of their post-quantum cryptographic standard. 

So, how do they work? We...Well, three of the algorithms are based on the mathematics of lattices. 

So, let's do a simple example in the 2D plane. Take two vectors, r1 and r2. By adding together different integer combinations of these vectors, say three times r1 and one time r2, you can get two different points. All the points you can get by combining these two vectors in different ways is what is called a lattice. 

Now, I will also give you the point C, and your task is to tell me which combination of r1 and r2 will bring me to the lattice point closest to C. It's pretty easy to see that we can get there by going in the direction of r2 twice and in the negative direction of r1 twice. Simple enough. 

But those vectors, r1 and r2, are not the only vectors that can give you this lattice. Take b1 and b2, for example. These vectors also build up the same lattice. 

Now, if I ask you the same question again, can you tell me the combination of b1 and b2 that gets you to the lattice point closest to C? This has become a...lot harder, but why is that? 

Each time we're taking a step, we're trying to get closer in either the X or Y direction. However, with the b vectors, each time we take a step in the right direction with one vector, it puts us off in the other direction. That's why these vectors are a lot harder to work with. 

In the end, it takes us a combination of eight times b1 and negative six times b2 to get to the closest lattice point. That is a lot harder than before, but it's still a relatively easy problem to solve. 

If we extend it to three dimensions, this already becomes a lot harder, especially because you're not given the collection of all lattice points. You're only given the vectors that make it up. So, when you find a lattice point close to the target, you must still find all the other lattice points near it to make sure yours is indeed the closest. 

Let's take a circle of radius r in two dimensions. The number of lattice points inside the circle is proportional to r squared. Add a third...The dimension and the number of points in the sphere is proportional to \( r^3 \). 

So, just watch how the number of lattice points grows as we increase the number of dimensions. 

Solving the closest vector problem is a piece of cake for your computer in three dimensions. Even a hundred dimensions should be manageable. 

But in proposed future encryption schemes, we'll use around a thousand dimensions. Take one step in the right direction on one of those dimensions, and you could potentially be taking a wrong step in the other 999 dimensions. You win some, you lose everything else. 

With that many dimensions, it becomes extremely hard to find the closest point, even for the most powerful computers. That is, unless you know a good set of vectors. 

So, how do we use that to encrypt data? Well, let's go back to our two-dimensional example. Each person has a good set of vectors that describes a lattice, but they keep these vectors secret, and they only share their lattice publicly using a set of vectors.That is hard to work with. 

Now, if I want to send someone a message, I pick a point on their lattice. For example, say this point corresponds to the number seven. So, if I want to send the number seven, I can take that point but then add some random noise to it. 

The message I send is not precisely at that point, but close to it. Now, to decode the message, my recipient must figure out which lattice point is closest to the message point. In a thousand dimensions, this will be extremely hard to do unless you have the nice set of vectors, which my recipient does. 

So, it's easy for the recipient, who has the good vectors, but hard for everyone else. As far as we know, this problem is extremely difficult to solve for both normal and quantum computers. 

Behind the scenes, there's an army of researchers, mathematicians, and cryptographers who are going to make sure your secret data stays secret. These are some of the unsung heroes that will keep us safe moving forward, avoiding mass surveillance.by governments, keeping critical infrastructure protected and allowing you to live as if quantum computers were never invented in the first place.

Summarize the article in 1000 words.
","The advent of quantum computing poses a significant threat to current encryption methods, which have been successful for over 40 years. The threat is so severe that nation-states and individual actors are intercepting and storing encrypted data, such as passwords, bank details, and social security numbers, even though they cannot currently decrypt them. This practice is known as ""Store Now, Decrypt Later"" (SNDL), and it is based on the assumption that within the next 10 to 20 years, a sufficiently powerful quantum computer will be developed, capable of breaking the encryption in minutes.

The current encryption schemes, known as public key algorithms, rely on the difficulty of factoring large numbers into their prime factors. For example, the RSA algorithm, developed by Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman in 1977, uses two large prime numbers, p and q, which are multiplied together to get a large number, N. The public key is N, while the private key is p and q. To decrypt a message, one needs to factor N into p and q, which is currently considered to be a difficult problem, even for supercomputers.

However, quantum computers can solve this problem much faster than classical computers. A quantum computer uses qubits, which can exist in a superposition of states, allowing it to perform many calculations simultaneously. This property makes quantum computers particularly well-suited to solving certain types of problems, including factoring large numbers. In 1994, Peter Shor and Don Coppersmith developed a quantum algorithm that can factor large numbers exponentially faster than any known classical algorithm.

The algorithm works by first preparing a superposition of states, then applying a series of quantum gates to the qubits, and finally measuring the result. The key step is the application of the quantum Fourier transform, which allows the extraction of frequency information from a periodic superposition. This information can then be used to find the period of the superposition, which is the key to factoring the large number.

To illustrate this process, consider a simple example where we want to factor a number N, which is the product of two primes, p and q. We start by making a ""bad guess"" for one of the factors, g, and then find the exponent r such that g^r is one more than a multiple of N. This can be done using a classical computer, but it is a slow process. However, a quantum computer can speed up this process exponentially.

Once we have found the exponent r, we can use it to turn our bad guess g into two numbers that likely share factors with N. We can then use Euclid's algorithm to find the factors of N and break the encryption. This process can be repeated for any large product of two primes, making it a powerful tool for breaking encryption.

The threat posed by quantum computers is so significant that the US Congress has passed legislation mandating that all agencies start transitioning to new methods of cryptography that can withstand attacks from both classical and quantum computers. In 2016, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) launched a competition to find new encryption algorithms that are resistant to quantum computers. After rigorous testing, NIST selected four algorithms to be part of their post-quantum cryptographic standard.

Three of the selected algorithms are based on the mathematics of lattices. A lattice is a set of points in a high-dimensional space that can be described by a set of vectors. The closest vector problem is to find the lattice point closest to a given point. This problem is easy to solve in low dimensions, but it becomes extremely hard to solve in high dimensions, even for the most powerful computers.

The idea behind lattice-based cryptography is to use a lattice with a large number of dimensions, making it hard for an attacker to find the closest lattice point. Each person has a secret set of vectors that describes the lattice, but they only share the lattice publicly using a set of vectors that is hard to work with. To encrypt a message, the sender picks a point on the lattice and adds some random noise to it. The recipient can then use their secret vectors to find the closest lattice point and decode the message.

The lattice-based algorithms are considered to be secure against both classical and quantum computers, making them a promising solution for post-quantum cryptography. However, the development of new encryption algorithms is an ongoing process, and it is likely that new threats and vulnerabilities will emerge in the future.

In conclusion, the advent of quantum computing poses a significant threat to current encryption methods, and it is essential to develop new methods of cryptography that can withstand attacks from both classical and quantum computers. The lattice-based algorithms selected by NIST are a promising solution, but it is crucial to continue researching and developing new encryption algorithms to stay ahead of potential threats.

The development of quantum computers and post-quantum cryptography is a complex and rapidly evolving field, and it is essential to stay informed about the latest developments. The video's sponsor, Brilliant, offers a range of courses and resources on quantum algorithms, cryptography, and data analysis, which can help individuals develop a deeper understanding of these topics.

In particular, Brilliant's course on quantum algorithms, co-developed with Microsoft and Alphabet X, provides an interactive and hands-on introduction to quantum computing and quantum algorithms. The course allows students to simulate quantum gates and write and execute real quantum algorithms, making it an excellent resource for those who want to learn more about this topic.

Additionally, Brilliant's course on data analysis provides an introduction to statistical reasoning and data visualization, which are essential skills for anyone interested in cryptography and post-quantum cryptography. The course uses everyday situations and interactive exercises to illustrate key concepts, making it an engaging and effective way to learn.

Overall, the development of quantum computers and post-quantum cryptography is a critical area of research, and it is essential to stay informed and develop new skills to stay ahead of potential threats. By learning more about quantum algorithms, cryptography, and data analysis, individuals can gain a deeper understanding of these topics and contribute to the development of new encryption algorithms and security protocols.",1232,10.233492612838743,120.389005651341

Right now, some nation-states and individual actors are intercepting and storing lots of encrypted data, like passwords, bank details, and social security numbers. But they can't open these files. So, why are they doing it? 

Well, because they believe that within the next 10 to 20 years, they will have access to a quantum computer that can break the encryption in minutes. This procedure is known as Store Now, Decrypt Later, or SNDL. It works because there is information available today that will still be valuable in a decade. 

Things like industrial and pharmaceutical research, and top-secret government intelligence, are all at risk, and everyone is aware of this threat. The National Security Administration says that a sufficiently large quantum computer, if built, would be capable of undermining all widely deployed public key algorithms. 

You know, in a five to ten year timeframe, quantum computing will break encryption as we know it today. 

Even though sufficiently powerful quantum computers are still years away...They're already a threat because of Store Now, Decrypt Later, which is why the US Congress just passed legislation mandating all agencies start transitioning right now to new methods of cryptography that can't be broken by quantum computers.

You know, our current encryption schemes have been remarkably successful, working effectively for over 40 years. Up until the 1970s, if you wanted to exchange private information with someone, you would first have to meet up in person and share a secret key. This same key would be used to encrypt and decrypt messages, so it's known as a symmetric key algorithm. As long as no one else gets their hands on the key, your messages are safe.

But now, what if you want to send information to someone you've never met, and it's too hard to arrange an in-person meeting? You can't share a key over an unsecured channel like a phone line or the mail, because it could be intercepted. 

This is what, in 1977, led three scientists—Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman—to develop a new approach.to come up with an encryption breakthrough. 

Today, it's known by their initials, RSA, and it works something like this: 

Every person has two really big prime numbers, all their own, which they keep secret. They multiply these numbers together to get an even bigger number, which they make public for everyone to see. 

Now, if I want to send someone a private message, I use their big public number to garble my message. I garble it in such a way that it is impossible to ungarble without knowing the two prime factors that made that number. 

This is an asymmetric key system, since different keys are used to encrypt and decrypt the message. So, it's easy for my intended recipient to decode, but impossible for everyone else, unless they can factor that large public number. 

Now, someone could try to factor it using a supercomputer. In the best-known factoring algorithm, the General Number Field Sieve, modern cryptography uses prime numbers that are around 313 digits long. Factoring a product of...If two primes are this big, even with a supercomputer, it would take around 16 million years. But not on a quantum computer.

See, in normal computers, a bit can only be in one state at a time, either a zero or a one. So, if you had two bits, they could be in one of four possible states: 00, 01, 10, or 11. Let's say each of these states represents a number: 0, 1, 2, or 3.

If we want to do a calculation, for example, raising seven to the power of one of these numbers, we can only do it for one state at a time. In this case, seven squared gives us the answer 49.

Quantum computers consist of qubits, which also have two states: zero or one. But unlike a classical bit, a qubit doesn't have to be in just one state at a time. It can be in an arbitrary combination of those states—a superposition, if you will—of zero and one. 

So, if you have two qubits, they can exist simultaneously in a superposition of 0, 1, 2, and 3. Now, when we repeat the same calculation, it will actually perform the calculation.for all of those numbers at the same time. 

And what we're left with is a superposition of the different answers: 1, 7, 49, and 343. 

If we add another qubit, we double the number of possible states. So with three qubits, we can represent eight states, and thus perform eight calculations all at once. 

Increase that number to just 20 qubits, and you can already represent over a million different states, meaning you can simultaneously compute over a million different answers. 

With 300 qubits, you can represent more states than there are particles in the observable universe. This sounds incredibly powerful, and it is, but there is one very big catch. 

All of the answers to the computation are embedded in a superposition of states, but you can't simply read out this superposition. When you make a measurement, you only get a single value from the superposition, basically at random, and all the other information is lost. 

So, in order to harness the power of a quantum computer, you need a smart way...to convert a superposition of states into one that contains only the information you want. This is an incredibly difficult task, which is why, for most applications, quantum computers are useless. 

So far, we've only identified a few problems where we can actually do this, but as luck would have it, these are precisely the problems that form the foundation of nearly all the public key cryptography we use today. 

In 1994, Peter Shor and Don Coppersmith figured out how to take a quantum Fourier transform. It works just like a normal Fourier transform: apply it to some periodic signal, and it returns the frequencies that are in that signal. 

Now, this may not seem particularly interesting, but consider this: if we have a superposition of states that is periodic, meaning the terms in the superposition are separated by some regular amount, we can apply the quantum Fourier transform and will be left with states that contain the frequency of the signal. 

So, this we can measure. The quantum F...Fourier transform allows us to extract frequency information from a periodic superposition, and that is going to come in handy.

So, how does a quantum computer factor the product of two primes much faster than a conventional computer? I want to explain this by first walking through a simple example with no quantum computer required, and then I'll show how a quantum computer could execute this method even for a very large number in a short period of time.

Let's say we have a number N, which is the product of two primes, p and q. For the sake of this example, let's set N equal to 77. Now, I bet you can guess the prime factors, but let's pretend for the moment that we don't know them, because with a product of really big primes, we wouldn't.

Now, I want to use a fact about numbers that feels like magic. Pick a number g that doesn't share any factors with N. If you multiply g by itself over and over and over, you will always eventually reach a multiple of N plus one. In other words, you can...Always find some exponent \( r \) such that \( g \) to the power of \( r \) is a multiple of \( N \) plus one. 

Let's see how this works. 

Pick any number that is smaller than 77. I'll pick the number eight. This number doesn't share factors with 77. If you were doing this with big primes, it would also be extremely unlikely that you just happen to pick a number that shares factors with \( N \). 

Now, multiply eight by itself once, twice, three times, four times, and so on, raising eight to ever higher powers. Then, divide each of these numbers by 77. We're not really interested in how many times 77 goes into the number, just the remainder—what's left over—because at some point, 77 should divide one of these numbers with a remainder of exactly one. 

So, eight divided by 77 is zero with a remainder of 8. Sixty-four divided by 77 is zero with a remainder of 64. Five hundred twelve divided by 77 is six with a remainder of 50. 

As we keep going, we get remainders of 15, 43, 36, 57, 71, 29, and finally one. 

So there we have it: eight to the power of 10 is...No more than a multiple of 77. 

So, we've found the exponent R that satisfies this equation. But how does this help find the factors of N? 

Well, we rearrange the equation to bring one over to the left-hand side, and then we can split it into two terms like so. 

Now, as long as R is even, we have one integer times another integer equal to a multiple of N. This looks remarkably similar to P times Q equals N. 

I mean, since we know that P and Q are on the right-hand side of this equation, they must also be on the left-hand side, just multiplied by some additional factors. 

One way to think about what we've done is that we've taken a bad guess for one of the factors, G, and by finding the exponent R, we've turned it into two much better guesses that probably do share factors with N. 

Since R was 10, the two terms on the left-hand side are eight to the power of five plus one, 32,769, and eight to the power of five minus one, 32,767. 

These two numbers probably share factors with N. So, how do we find...And them? 

We use Euclid's algorithm. 

If you want to find the greatest common divisor of two numbers, say 32,769 and 77, divide the bigger number by the smaller one and record the remainder. 

In this case, 32,769 divided by 77 gives a remainder of 44. Then, shift the numbers one position left and repeat. 

So now we divide 77 by 44, and we get a remainder of 33. Repeat the process again. 

44 divided by 33 gives a remainder of 11, and again, 33 divided by 11 equals 3 with a remainder of zero. 

When the remainder is zero, the divisor is the greatest common factor between the two numbers you started with. In this case, it's 11, which is indeed a factor of 77 and 32,769. 

You could do the same procedure with the other number or just divide 77 by 11 to get 7, its other prime factor. 

So to recap, if you want to find the prime factors p and q of a number N, first, make a bad guess, g. Second, find out how many times r you have to multiply g by itself to reach one more than a multiple of N. Third, use that expo...to calculate two new numbers that probably do share factors with N. 

And finally, use Euclid's algorithm to find the shared factors between those numbers and N, which should give you p and q. 

Now, you don't need a quantum computer to run any of these steps, but on a classical computer, this method wouldn't be any faster than other methods. 

The key process that a quantum computer speeds up is step two: finding the exponent you raise G2 to equal one more than a multiple of N. 

To see why, let's go back to our example, where eight to the power of 10 is one more than a multiple of 77. 

Watch what happens to the remainders if we keep going past eight to the power of 10, to eight to the 11, eight to the 12, and so on. 

Well, we get remainders of 8, 64, 50, 15, 43, 36, 57, 71, 29, and again one. 

The remainders cycle, and they will just keep cycling. 

Notice how the exponent that yields a remainder of one is 20, which is 10 more than the first exponent that yielded a remainder of one. 

So we know that...At eight to the 30 and eight to the 40, eight raised to any power divisible by 10 will also be one more than a multiple of 77. 

It's also worth noting that if you pick any remainder, say 15, the next time you find that same remainder, the exponent will have increased by 10. 

So, you can find the exponent R that gets us to one more than a multiple of n by looking at the spacing of any remainder, not just one. Remember that. 

Here, I'm plotting out the remainders on a log scale so you can see they are periodic with a period of 10. If I had made a different guess, say I had picked G equals 15 instead of eight, well then the period would be different and the remainders would be different, but there would always be a remainder of one. 

Why is this? Well, now that you can see this is a repeating pattern, we can go back to the beginning. Any number raised to the power of zero is one, so that is actually the first remainder. It must also appear when the cycle starts again. 

Now we are ready to use a...Quantum computer to factor any large product of two primes. 

First, we split up the qubits into two sets. The first set we prepare in a superposition of zero, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, and nine, all the way up to 10 to the power of 1,234. 

Yeah, this is a huge superposition, but if we had perfect qubits, it would require only around 4,100. The other set contains a similar number of qubits, all left in the zero state for now. 

Now we make our guess, G, which most likely doesn't share factors with N. We raise G to the power of the first set of qubits, then we divide by N and store the remainder in the second set of qubits, leaving the first set of qubits as it was. 

Now we have a superposition of all the numbers we started with and the remainder of raising G to the power of those numbers divided by N. Through this operation, we have entangled our two sets of qubits, but we can't just measure this superposition. If we did, we would get a random...Value and learn nothing. 

But there is a trick we can use. If we don't measure the entire superposition, but only the remainder part, we will obtain some random remainder. However, this remainder won't occur just once. It will occur multiple times, every time it comes up in the cycle. 

Imagine we were doing this with the example from before, with N equals 77 and G equals 8. If the remainder we measured was, say, 15, then there would be multiple terms in our superposition. This is because there are multiple exponents you can raise G to that give this same remainder: exponents 4, 14, 24, 34, and so on. They are each separated by 10, and that value is the exponent that satisfies our equation. 

More generally, after measuring the remainder, we will be left with a superposition of states that all share the same remainder, and the exponents will all be separated by the same amount, r. This is the number we are looking for. Since the remainder is now the same for all states, we can put it to the side, and we no...We have a superposition that is periodic. Each term is separated from its neighbors by an amount R. 

If we now apply the quantum Fourier transform to this superposition of states—and I'm simplifying a little here—we will be left with states containing one over R. 

So all that's left to do now is perform a measurement and find R by inverting it, and that's it for the quantum part. 

Now, as long as R turns out to be even, we can use R to turn our bad guess G into two numbers that likely share factors with N. As long as these terms themselves are not a multiple of N, we can use Euclid's algorithm to find the factors of N and break the encryption. 

This would only take several thousand perfect qubits, but the qubits we have today are imperfect, so we need additional qubits to act as redundant information. 

In 2012, it was estimated that it would take a billion physical qubits to break RSA encryption, but by five years later, that number had dropped to 230 million. 

And in 2019, after more tech...Technological breakthroughs have led to significant advancements in quantum computing. 

That estimate plummeted to just 20 million physical qubits. 

So, how many qubits do we have today? 

Well, if we look at the state of IBM's quantum computers, we are nowhere near that number of qubits, but progress looks to be exponential. 

So now it's just a question of when these two curves will collide before all our existing public key encryption can be broken. 

Because we've long known this threat is coming, scientists have been looking for new ways to encrypt data that can withstand attacks from both normal and quantum computers. 

In 2016, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, or NIST, launched a competition to find new encryption algorithms that aren't vulnerable to quantum computers. 

Cryptographers from all over the world submitted 82 different proposals, which were rigorously tested; some were broken. 

Then, on July 5th, 2022, NIST selected four of the algorithms to be part of their post-quantum cryptographic standard. 

So, how do they work? We...Well, three of the algorithms are based on the mathematics of lattices. 

So, let's do a simple example in the 2D plane. Take two vectors, r1 and r2. By adding together different integer combinations of these vectors, say three times r1 and one time r2, you can get two different points. All the points you can get by combining these two vectors in different ways is what is called a lattice. 

Now, I will also give you the point C, and your task is to tell me which combination of r1 and r2 will bring me to the lattice point closest to C. It's pretty easy to see that we can get there by going in the direction of r2 twice and in the negative direction of r1 twice. Simple enough. 

But those vectors, r1 and r2, are not the only vectors that can give you this lattice. Take b1 and b2, for example. These vectors also build up the same lattice. 

Now, if I ask you the same question again, can you tell me the combination of b1 and b2 that gets you to the lattice point closest to C? This has become a...lot harder, but why is that? 

Each time we're taking a step, we're trying to get closer in either the X or Y direction. However, with the b vectors, each time we take a step in the right direction with one vector, it puts us off in the other direction. That's why these vectors are a lot harder to work with. 

In the end, it takes us a combination of eight times b1 and negative six times b2 to get to the closest lattice point. That is a lot harder than before, but it's still a relatively easy problem to solve. 

If we extend it to three dimensions, this already becomes a lot harder, especially because you're not given the collection of all lattice points. You're only given the vectors that make it up. So, when you find a lattice point close to the target, you must still find all the other lattice points near it to make sure yours is indeed the closest. 

Let's take a circle of radius r in two dimensions. The number of lattice points inside the circle is proportional to r squared. Add a third...The dimension and the number of points in the sphere is proportional to \( r^3 \). 

So, just watch how the number of lattice points grows as we increase the number of dimensions. 

Solving the closest vector problem is a piece of cake for your computer in three dimensions. Even a hundred dimensions should be manageable. 

But in proposed future encryption schemes, we'll use around a thousand dimensions. Take one step in the right direction on one of those dimensions, and you could potentially be taking a wrong step in the other 999 dimensions. You win some, you lose everything else. 

With that many dimensions, it becomes extremely hard to find the closest point, even for the most powerful computers. That is, unless you know a good set of vectors. 

So, how do we use that to encrypt data? Well, let's go back to our two-dimensional example. Each person has a good set of vectors that describes a lattice, but they keep these vectors secret, and they only share their lattice publicly using a set of vectors.That is hard to work with. 

Now, if I want to send someone a message, I pick a point on their lattice. For example, say this point corresponds to the number seven. So, if I want to send the number seven, I can take that point but then add some random noise to it. 

The message I send is not precisely at that point, but close to it. Now, to decode the message, my recipient must figure out which lattice point is closest to the message point. In a thousand dimensions, this will be extremely hard to do unless you have the nice set of vectors, which my recipient does. 

So, it's easy for the recipient, who has the good vectors, but hard for everyone else. As far as we know, this problem is extremely difficult to solve for both normal and quantum computers. 

Behind the scenes, there's an army of researchers, mathematicians, and cryptographers who are going to make sure your secret data stays secret. These are some of the unsung heroes that will keep us safe moving forward, avoiding mass surveillance.by governments, keeping critical infrastructure protected and allowing you to live as if quantum computers were never invented in the first place.

Summarize the article in 1000 words.
","The world of cryptography is facing a significant threat from the emergence of quantum computers. Currently, many nation-states and individual actors are intercepting and storing large amounts of encrypted data, including passwords, bank details, and social security numbers. Although they cannot access this data now, they are doing so in anticipation of developing a quantum computer that can break the encryption in the near future. This approach is known as ""Store Now, Decrypt Later"" (SNDL).

The threat posed by quantum computers is significant because they have the potential to break many of the encryption algorithms currently in use. The National Security Administration has warned that a sufficiently large quantum computer could undermine all widely deployed public key algorithms. This is a major concern because many of these algorithms have been in use for over 40 years and are still widely used today.

To understand the threat posed by quantum computers, it is essential to understand how encryption works. Prior to the 1970s, encryption relied on symmetric key algorithms, where the same key was used to encrypt and decrypt messages. However, this approach had a significant limitation: it required the parties involved to meet in person to share the secret key. This made it impractical for many applications, such as online transactions.

In 1977, three scientists - Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman - developed a new approach to encryption, known as RSA. This algorithm uses asymmetric keys, where a public key is used to encrypt messages, and a private key is used to decrypt them. The public key is generated by multiplying two large prime numbers together, and the private key is used to factorize the public key.

RSA is widely used today, but it is vulnerable to attack by a sufficiently large quantum computer. This is because quantum computers can perform certain types of calculations much faster than classical computers. In particular, they can factorize large numbers much faster than classical computers, which makes them a significant threat to RSA.

To factorize a large number, a quantum computer uses a process called the quantum Fourier transform. This process allows the quantum computer to find the periodicity of a function, which is essential for factorizing large numbers. The quantum Fourier transform is a powerful tool that has many applications in cryptography, but it also poses a significant threat to many encryption algorithms.

The process of factorizing a large number using a quantum computer involves several steps. First, a guess is made for one of the factors, and then the exponent is found that satisfies the equation. This exponent is then used to generate two new numbers that likely share factors with the original number. Finally, Euclid's algorithm is used to find the greatest common divisor of these two numbers, which gives the factors of the original number.

While quantum computers pose a significant threat to many encryption algorithms, researchers are working on developing new algorithms that are resistant to quantum computer attacks. One approach is to use lattice-based cryptography, which is based on the difficulty of finding the closest point in a high-dimensional lattice. This problem is known to be hard for both classical and quantum computers, which makes it a promising approach for developing quantum-resistant encryption algorithms.

In 2016, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) launched a competition to find new encryption algorithms that are resistant to quantum computer attacks. The competition attracted 82 submissions from cryptographers around the world, and in 2022, NIST selected four algorithms to be part of their post-quantum cryptographic standard. Three of these algorithms are based on lattice-based cryptography, which is a promising approach for developing quantum-resistant encryption algorithms.

To understand how lattice-based cryptography works, consider a simple example in two dimensions. Imagine a lattice generated by two vectors, and a point that is close to the lattice. The goal is to find the combination of vectors that brings us to the lattice point closest to the given point. This problem is easy to solve in two dimensions, but it becomes much harder in higher dimensions.

In lattice-based cryptography, each person has a secret set of vectors that generates a lattice, and a public set of vectors that is hard to work with. To encrypt a message, the sender adds noise to a point on the lattice, and the recipient must find the closest lattice point to the noisy point. This problem is hard for both classical and quantum computers, unless the recipient has the secret set of vectors.

The development of quantum-resistant encryption algorithms is an active area of research, and it is essential for ensuring the security of online transactions in the future. While quantum computers pose a significant threat to many encryption algorithms, researchers are working on developing new algorithms that are resistant to these attacks. By understanding how encryption works and how quantum computers pose a threat, we can develop new algorithms that are secure against these attacks.

In conclusion, the emergence of quantum computers poses a significant threat to many encryption algorithms currently in use. However, researchers are working on developing new algorithms that are resistant to quantum computer attacks. Lattice-based cryptography is a promising approach for developing quantum-resistant encryption algorithms, and it is based on the difficulty of finding the closest point in a high-dimensional lattice. By understanding how encryption works and how quantum computers pose a threat, we can develop new algorithms that are secure against these attacks and ensure the security of online transactions in the future.

The importance of developing quantum-resistant encryption algorithms cannot be overstated. As quantum computers become more powerful, they will pose a significant threat to many encryption algorithms currently in use. This could have serious consequences, including the compromise of sensitive information and the disruption of online transactions. By developing new algorithms that are resistant to quantum computer attacks, we can ensure the security of online transactions and protect sensitive information.

In addition to lattice-based cryptography, there are other approaches to developing quantum-resistant encryption algorithms. These include code-based cryptography, hash-based signatures, and multivariate cryptography. Each of these approaches has its own strengths and weaknesses, and researchers are working to develop new algorithms that are secure against quantum computer attacks.

The development of quantum-resistant encryption algorithms is a complex and challenging task. It requires a deep understanding of cryptography, quantum mechanics, and computer science. However, it is an essential task, and one that will have a significant impact on the security of online transactions in the future. By developing new algorithms that are resistant to quantum computer attacks, we can ensure the security of sensitive information and protect against the threats posed by quantum computers.
